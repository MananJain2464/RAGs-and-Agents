       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and ODI cricket for the national team and is a former captain in all formats. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional right arm medium pace bowler. Kohli holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, he holds the record for the most centuries in ODIs and has the second most centuries in international cricket all time.[5]\\n\\nKohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and also captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6] He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic cricket.\\n\\nIn 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ODI batsmen ICC rankings. In 2015, he also achieved the same for T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked the top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the ICC named him the male cricketer of the decade.[8]\\n\\nKohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards making him the most awarded player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the most Player of the Series awards and second most Player of the Match awards to his name in all three formats combined. He was honored with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India\\'s highest sporting honor, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\\n\\nAfter winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and the Player of the Match in the Final, Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is.[9]\\n\\nEarly life\\nVirat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[10] Kohli\\'s formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.[12]\\n\\nIn 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli arranged for his son to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[13] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli\\'s father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[14] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[16] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[14]\\n\\nOn 18 December 2006, Kohli\\'s father died due to a cerebral attack. According to his mother, Kohli\\'s demeanour shifted noticeably after his father\\'s death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[14] Kohli\\'s family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[19]\\n\\n2008â€“2009: Debut and maiden stint\\nIn August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[20] So, his selection was considered a \"surprise call-up\".[21] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[22] On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[23] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[24]\\n\\nFollowing the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[25] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[26] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President\\'s XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[27]\\n\\nIn November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England. However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[28] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive â‚¹1.5 million (equivalent to â‚¹4.2 million or US$48,000 in 2023).[29] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[30]\\n\\nIn Julyâ€“August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament\\'s leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[31][32] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli\\'s performance during the tournament.[33] Kohli later stated that this tournament was a \"turning point\" in his career.[34]\\n\\nIn August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[35] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[36] In December of that year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI.[37] However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely, which led to Kohli\\'s return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata.[38] In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI centuryâ€“107 off 114 ballsâ€“while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3â€“1.[39][b]\\n\\nPlayer profile\\nComparisons to Sachin Tendulkar\\nKohli\\'s batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar\\'s \"successor\",[40][41] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[42][43] Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar\\'s style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[44] Kohli\\'s aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli\\'s similarities to his own playing style.[45] He has been lauded as the \"new king of world cricket\" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[46] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[47] Kohli\\'s skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[48]\\n\\nIn a discourse with Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli\\'s batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[49] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team.[50]\\n\\nKohli became the fastest player to score 27,000 runs in international cricket. He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record, achieving the feat in 594 innings compared to Tendulkar\\'s 623, during the second Test against Bangladesh at Green Park Stadium. Kohli now joins Ricky Ponting and Kumar Sangakkara as the only players to have crossed this milestone in international cricket.[51]')]"

This article will help you to understand the following topics:Task: How will you choose the best mangoes?Given below is set of learning, human gains from his experience of shopping mangoes, you can drill it down to have a further look at it in detail. Go through it once, you will relate it to machine learning very easily.You were informed that bright and yellow mangoes are sweeter than pale and yellow ones.So you make a simple rule: pick only from the bright yellow mangoes. You check the color of the mangoes, pick the bright yellow ones, pay up, and return home. Right?Now when you went home and tasted the mangoes, some of them were not sweet as you thought. You are worried as your wisdom was insufficient. You concluded that when it comes shopping mangoes, you have to look for more than just the colours.After a lot of pondering and tasting different types of mangoes, you concluded that the bigger and bright yellow mangoes are guaranteed to be sweet, while the smaller, bright yellow mangoes are sweet only half the time (i.e. if you bought 100 bright yellow mangoes (50 will be big in size and rest 50 will be small), then the 50 big mangoes will all be sweet, while out of the 50 small ones, only 25 mangoes will turn out to be sweet). You will then update your rule about the mango shopping and from next time you will keep this in mind.Tragedy: Next time at the market, you see that your favorite vendor has gone out of town. You decide to buy from a different vendor, who supplies mangoes grown from a different part of the country. Now, you realize that the rule which you had learned (that big, bright yellow mangoes are the sweetest) is no longer applicable. You have to learn from scratch. You taste a mango of each kind from this vendor and realize that the small, pale yellow ones are in fact the sweetest of all.One day your cousin visits you from another city. You decide to treat her with mangoes. But she is like “I don’t care about the sweetness of a mango, I only want the juiciest ones”. Now once again, you run your experiments, tasting all kinds of mangoes, and realizing that the softer ones are juicier.Later on, you move to a different part of the world and you found that the mangoes here taste surprisingly different from your home country. You realized that for this country the green mangoes are tastier than the yellow ones.You marry someone who hates mangoes but loves oranges instead. Now you go shopping oranges instead of mangoes. Now, all your accumulated knowledge about mangoes is worthless. Now you have to learn everything about the correlation between the physical characteristics and the taste of apples, by the same method of experimentation.if is bright yellow and size is big and sold by: mango is sweet.if (soft): mango is juicyYou would use these rules to choose the mangoes.You have to understand the details of all the factors affecting the quality of mangoes. If the problem gets complicated enough, it might get difficult for you to make accurate rules by hand that covers all possible types of mangoes. This will take a lot of research and effort and not everyone has this amount of time.Machine Learning algorithms are an evolution of normal algorithms. They make your programs “smarter”, by allowing them to automatically learn from the data you provide. The algorithm is mainly divided into:You take a randomly selected specimen of mangoes from the market (training data), make a table of all the physical characteristics of each mango, like color, size, shape, grown in which part of the country, sold by which vendor, etc (features), along with the sweetness, juiciness, ripeness of that mango (output variables). You feed this data to the machine learning algorithm (classification/regression), and it learns a model of the correlation between an average mango’s physical characteristics, and its quality.Next time when you go shopping, you will measure the characteristics of the mangoes which you are purchasing(test data)and feed it to the Machine Learning algorithm. It will use the model which was computed earlier to predict if the mangoes are sweet, ripe and/or juicy. The algorithm may internally use the rules, similar to the one you manually wrote earlier (for eg, a decision tree). Finally, you can now shop for mangoes with great confidence, without worrying about the details of how to choose the best mangoes.The best part of this is, you can use the same algorithm to train different models. You can create one each for predicting the quality of apples, grapes, bananas, or whatever you want.Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a smarter way. It covers anything which enables computers to behave like humans.Machine Learning is a subset of AI and is based on the idea that machines should be given access to data, and should be left to learn and explore for themselves. It deals with the extraction of patterns from large data sets.Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where similar Machine Learning Algorithms are used to train Deep Neural Networks so as to achieve better accuracy in those cases where former was not performing up to the mark.Let’s categorize Machine Learning into its subparts and see what each of them are, how they work, and how each one of them is used in real life.Starting with Supervised Learning, So what is it?Supervised learning is the one where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. it,The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that whenever you get some new input data (x), the machine can easily predict the output variables (Y) for that data.Let me rephrase you this in simple terms:In Supervised machine learning algorithm, every instance of the training dataset consists of input attributes and expected output. The training dataset can take any kind of data as input like values of a database row, the pixels of an image, or even an audio frequency histogram.Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is termed as supervised learning?This category is termed as supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher teaching his students. The algorithm continuously predicts the result on the basis of training data and is continuously corrected by the teacher. The learning continues until the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.Cortana or any speech automated system in your mobile phone trains your voice and then starts working based on this training. This is an application of Supervised LearningPredicts the upcoming weather by analyzing the parameters for a given time on some prior knowledge (when its sunny, temperature is higher; when its cloudy, humidity is higher, etc.).In Biometric Attendance you can train the machine with inputs of your biometric identity — it can be your thumb, iris or ear-lobe, etc. Once the machine is trained it can validate your future input and can easily identify you.Mathematically, Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.Let me rephrase it for you in simple terms:In the unsupervised learning approach, the sample of a training dataset does not have an expected output associated with them. Using the unsupervised learning algorithms you can detect patterns based on the typical characteristics of the input data. Clustering can be considered as an example of a machine learning task that uses the unsupervised learning approach. The machine then groups similar data samples and identify different clusters within the data.Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised learning?Well, this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised because unlike supervised learning there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover and return the interesting structure in the data.A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. Since you didn’t have any prior knowledge about people and so you just classified them “on-the-go”.Let’s suppose you have never seen a Football match before and by chance watch a video on the internet, now you can classify players on the basis of different criterion like Players wearing the same sort of kits are in one class, Players of one style are in one class (players, goalkeeper, referee), or on the basis of playing style(attacker or defender) or whatever way you would observe, you can classify it.Reinforcement learning can be thought of as a hit and trial method of learning. The machine gets a Reward or Penalty point for each action it performs. If the option is correct, the machine gains the reward point or gets a penalty point in case of a wrong response.The reinforcement learning algorithm is all about the interaction between the environment and the learning agent. The learning agent is based on exploration and exploitation.Exploration is when the learning agent acts on trial and error and Exploitation is when it performs an action based on the knowledge gained from the environment. The environment rewards the agent for every correct action, which is the reinforcement signal. With the aim of collecting more rewards obtained, the agent improves its environment knowledge to choose or perform the next action.Let see how Pavlov trained his dog using reinforcement training?Pavlov divided the training of his dog into four stages.In the first part, Pavlov gave meat to the dog, and in response to the meat, the dog started salivating.In the next stage he created a sound with a bell, but this time the dogs did not respond to anything.In the third stage, he tried to train his dog by using the bell and then giving them food. Seeing the food the dog started salivating.Eventually, the dogs started salivating just after hearing the bell, even if the food was not given as the dog was reinforced that whenever the master will ring the bell, he will get the food.It’s a good project and is really very easy to understand.All the attributes within the dataset are numeric, you just have to figure out how to load and handle dataIt is a multi-class classification problem thereby allowing you to practice the supervised learning algorithm4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memoryAll of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get startedIf you wish to check out more articles on the market’s most trending technologies like Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Ethical Hacking, then you can refer to Edureka’s official site.Do look out for other articles in this series which will explain the various other aspects of Python and Data Science.Originally published at www.edureka.co on May 29, 2018.')]"

I have seldom heard him men-\\ntion her under any other name. In his eyes\\nshe eclipses and predominates the whole\\nof her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin\\nto love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one\\nparticularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but\\nadmirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most\\nperfect reasoning and observing machine that the\\nworld has seen, but as a lover he would have placed\\nhimself in a false position. He never spoke of the\\nsofter passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They\\nwere admirable things for the observer—excellent for\\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But\\nfor the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into\\nhis own delicate and ﬁnely adjusted temperament was\\nto introduce a distracting factor which might throw a\\ndoubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power\\nlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong\\nemotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was\\nbut one woman to him, and that woman was the late\\nIrene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had\\ndrifted us away from each other. My own complete\\nhappiness, and the home-centred interests which rise\\nup around the man who ﬁrst ﬁnds himself master of\\nhis own establishment, were sufﬁcient to absorb all\\nmy attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form\\nof society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained\\nin our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between\\ncocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug,\\nand the ﬁerce energy of his own keen nature. He was\\nstill, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary\\npowers of observation in following out those clues,\\nand clearing up those mysteries which had been aban-\\ndoned as hopeless by the ofﬁcial police. From time\\nto time I heard some vague account of his doings:\\nof his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff\\nmurder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of\\nthe Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and ﬁnally of\\nthe mission which he had accomplished so delicately\\nand successfully for the reigning family of Holland.\\nBeyond these signs of his activity, however, which I\\nmerely shared with all the readers of the daily press,\\nI knew little of my former friend and companion.\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March,\\n1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient\\n(for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\\nway led me through Baker Street. As I passed the\\nwell-remembered door, which must always be associ-\\nated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he\\nwas employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms\\nwere brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw\\nhis tall, spare ﬁgure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,\\neagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his\\nhands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his\\nevery mood and habit, his attitude and manner told\\ntheir own story. He was at work again. He had risen\\nout of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the\\nscent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was\\nshown up to the chamber which had formerly been\\nin part my own.\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but\\nhe was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word\\nspoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\\narmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indi-\\ncated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then\\nhe stood before the ﬁre and looked me over in his\\nsingular introspective fashion.\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Wat-\\nson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds\\nsince I saw you.”\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just\\na triﬂe more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I\\nobserve. You did not tell me that you intended to go\\ninto harness.”\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you\\nhave been getting yourself very wet lately, and that\\nyou have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You\\nwould certainly have been burned, had you lived a\\nfew centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk\\non Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but\\nas I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you\\ndeduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and\\nmy wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail\\nto see how you work it out.”\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, ner-\\nvous hands together.\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me\\nthat on the inside of your left shoe, just where the\\nﬁrelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost\\n5'),\n",

Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the\\nedges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud\\nfrom it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that\\nyou had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\\nLondon slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman\\nwalks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a\\nblack mark of nitrate of silver upon his right foreﬁn-\\nger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to\\nshow where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must\\nbe dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an\\nactive member of the medical profession.”\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which\\nhe explained his process of deduction. “When I hear\\nyou give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always\\nappears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\\neasily do it myself, though at each successive instance\\nof your reasoning I am bafﬂed until you explain your\\nprocess. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\\nas yours.”\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and\\nthrowing himself down into an armchair. “You see,\\nbut you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For\\nexample, you have frequently seen the steps which\\nlead up from the hall to this room.”\\n“Frequently.”\\n“How often?”\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you\\nhave seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that\\nthere are seventeen steps, because I have both seen\\nand observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in\\nthese little problems, and since you are good enough\\nto chronicle one or two of my triﬂing experiences, you\\nmay be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of\\nthick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying\\nopen upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said\\nhe. “Read it aloud.”\\nThe note was undated, and without either signa-\\nture or address.\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to\\neight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to\\nconsult you upon a matter of the very deepest mo-\\nment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses\\nof Europe have shown that you are one who may\\nsafely be trusted with matters which are of an impor-\\ntance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account\\nof you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if\\nyour visitor wear a mask.”\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do\\nyou imagine that it means?”\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to the-\\norize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to\\ntwist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit\\nfacts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\nit?”\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper\\nupon which it was written.\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to\\ndo,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my com-\\npanion’s processes. “Such paper could not be bought\\nunder half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong\\nand stiff.”\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes.\\n“It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the\\nlight.”\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a\\n“P ,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into the\\ntexture of the paper.\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his mono-\\ngram, rather.”\\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for\\n‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’\\nIt is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P ,’ of\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down\\na heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow,\\nEglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-\\nspeaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carls-\\nbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of\\nWallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and\\npaper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\nthat?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue\\ntriumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is\\na German. Do you note the peculiar construction of\\nthe sentence—‘This account of you we have from all\\nquarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could\\nnot have written that. It is the German who is so un-\\ncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to\\ndiscover what is wanted by this German who writes\\nupon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask\\nto showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not\\nmistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”\\n6'),\n",

Holmes whistled.\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he con-\\ntinued, glancing out of the window. “A nice little\\nbrougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and ﬁfty\\nguineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if\\nthere is nothing else.”\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am\\nlost without my Boswell. And this promises to be\\ninteresting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n“But your client—”\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so\\nmay he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair,\\nDoctor, and give us your best attention.”\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard\\nupon the stairs and in the passage, paused immedi-\\nately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less\\nthan six feet six inches in height, with the chest and\\nlimbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness\\nwhich would, in England, be looked upon as akin to\\nbad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed\\nacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted\\ncoat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown\\nover his shoulders was lined with ﬂame-coloured\\nsilk and secured at the neck with a brooch which con-\\nsisted of a single ﬂaming beryl. Boots which extended\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at\\nthe tops with rich brown fur, completed the impres-\\nsion of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his\\nwhole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat\\nin his hand, while he wore across the upper part of\\nhis face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\\nvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that\\nvery moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he\\nentered. From the lower part of the face he appeared\\nto be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging\\nlip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution\\npushed to the length of obstinacy.\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh\\nvoice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told\\nyou that I would call.” He looked from one to the\\nother of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend\\nand colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good\\nenough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the\\nhonour to address?”\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm,\\na Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentle-\\nman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion,\\nwhom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communi-\\ncate with you alone.”\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist\\nand pushed me back into my chair. “It is both, or\\nnone,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman\\nanything which you may say to me.”\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I\\nmust begin,” said he, “by binding you both to abso-\\nlute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the\\nmatter will be of no importance. At present it is not\\ntoo much to say that it is of such weight it may have\\nan inﬂuence upon European history.”\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n“And I.”\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our\\nstrange visitor. “The august person who employs\\nme wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I\\nmay confess at once that the title by which I have just\\ncalled myself is not exactly my own.”\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and ev-\\nery precaution has to be taken to quench what might\\ngrow to be an immense scandal and seriously com-\\npromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To\\nspeak plainly, the matter implicates the great House\\nof Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes,\\nsettling himself down in his armchair and closing his\\neyes.\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise\\nat the languid, lounging ﬁgure of the man who had\\nbeen no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive\\nreasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at\\nhis gigantic client.\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your\\ncase,” he remarked, “I should be better able to advise\\nyou.”\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and\\ndown the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then,\\nwith a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from\\nhis face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are\\nright,” he cried; “I am the King. Why should I at-\\ntempt to conceal it?”\\n7'),\n",

Yet the matter was so delicate that I could\\nnot conﬁde it to an agent without putting myself in\\nhis power. I have come incognito from Prague for the\\npurpose of consulting you.”\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his\\neyes once more.\\n“The facts are brieﬂy these: Some ﬁve years ago,\\nduring a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquain-\\ntance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The\\nname is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” mur-\\nmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many\\nyears he had adopted a system of docketing all para-\\ngraphs concerning men and things, so that it was\\ndifﬁcult to name a subject or a person on which he\\ncould not at once furnish information. In this case I\\nfound her biography sandwiched in between that of\\na Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who\\nhad written a monograph upon the deep-sea ﬁshes.\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in\\nNew Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto—hum! La\\nScala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of War-\\nsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living\\nin London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand,\\nbecame entangled with this young person, wrote her\\nsome compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\ngetting those letters back.”\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n“None.”\\n“No legal papers or certiﬁcates?”\\n“None.”\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young\\nperson should produce her letters for blackmailing or\\nother purposes, how is she to prove their authentic-\\nity?”\\n“There is the writing.”\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n“Stolen.”\\n“My own seal.”\\n“Imitated.”\\n“My photograph.”\\n“Bought.”\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has\\nindeed committed an indiscretion.”\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am\\nbut thirty now.”\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n“She will not sell.”\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars\\nin my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted\\nher luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been\\nwaylaid. There has been no result.”\\n“No sign of it?”\\n“Absolutely none.”\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little prob-\\nlem,” said he.\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King\\nreproachfully.\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do\\nwith the photograph?”\\n“To ruin me.”\\n“But how?”\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n“So I have heard.”\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second\\ndaughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know\\nthe strict principles of her family. She is herself the\\nvery soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my\\nconduct would bring the matter to an end.”\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she\\nwill do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know\\nher, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the\\nmost beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another\\nwoman, there are no lengths to which she would not\\ngo—none.”\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n“I am sure.”\\n8'),\n",

And\\ngood-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the\\nroyal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will\\nbe good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three\\no’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with\\nyou.”\\nCHAPTER II.\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street,\\nbut Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady in-\\nformed me that he had left the house shortly after\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\\nﬁre, however, with the intention of awaiting him, how-\\never long he might be. I was already deeply inter-\\nested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded\\nby none of the grim and strange features which were\\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already\\nrecorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted\\nstation of his client gave it a character of its own. In-\\ndeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which\\nmy friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive\\nreasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study\\nhis system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle\\nmethods by which he disentangled the most inextrica-\\nble mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable\\nsuccess that the very possibility of his failing had\\nceased to enter into my head.\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened,\\nand a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-\\nwhiskered, with an inﬂamed face and disreputable\\nclothes, walked into the room.

I\\nwill tell you, however. I left the house a little after\\neight o’clock this morning in the character of a groom\\nout of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and\\nyou will know all that there is to know. I soon found\\nBriony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the\\nback, but built out in front right up to the road, two\\nstories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room\\non the right side, well furnished, with long windows\\nalmost to the ﬂoor, and those preposterous English\\nwindow fasteners which a child could open. Behind\\nthere was nothing remarkable, save that the passage\\nwindow could be reached from the top of the coach-\\nhouse. I walked round it and examined it closely from\\nevery point of view, but without noting anything else\\nof interest.\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I\\nexpected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs\\ndown by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received\\nin exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two\\nﬁlls of shag tobacco, and as much information as I\\ncould desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a\\ndozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I\\nwas not in the least interested, but whose biographies\\nI was compelled to listen to.”\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in\\nthat part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet\\non this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.\\nShe lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at ﬁve\\nevery day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Sel-\\ndom goes out at other times, except when she sings.\\nHas only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.\\nHe is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less\\nthan once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a\\ncabman as a conﬁdant. They had driven him home\\na dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all\\nabout him. When I had listened to all they had to tell,\\nI began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once\\nmore, and to think over my plan of campaign.\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important\\nfactor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded\\nominous. What was the relation between them, and\\nwhat the object of his repeated visits? Was she his\\nclient, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she\\nhad probably transferred the photograph to his keep-\\ning. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of\\nthis question depended whether I should continue\\nmy work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\ngentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate\\npoint, and it widened the ﬁeld of my inquiry. I fear\\nthat I bore you with these details, but I have to let you\\nsee my little difﬁculties, if you are to understand the\\nsituation.”\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when\\na hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gen-\\ntleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome\\nman, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the\\nman of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in\\na great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and\\nbrushed past the maid who opened the door with the\\nair of a man who was thoroughly at home.\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I\\ncould catch glimpses of him in the windows of the\\nsitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing.\\nPresently he emerged, looking even more ﬂurried\\nthan before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a\\ngold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly,\\n‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘ﬁrst to Gross &\\nHankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of\\nSt. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if\\nyou do it in twenty minutes!’\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering\\nwhether I should not do well to follow them when up\\nthe lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with\\nhis coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,\\nwhile all the tags of his harness were sticking out of\\nthe buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out\\nof the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse\\nof her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman,\\nwith a face that a man might die for.\\n“ ‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and\\nhalf a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was\\njust balancing whether I should run for it, or whether\\nI should perch behind her landau when a cab came\\nthrough the street. The driver looked twice at such\\na shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could ob-\\nject. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a\\nsovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was\\ntwenty-ﬁve minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove\\nfaster, but the others were there before us. The cab\\nand the landau with their steaming horses were in\\nfront of the door when I arrived. I paid the man\\nand hurried into the church. There was not a soul\\nthere save the two whom I had followed and a sur-\\npliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating\\n10'),\n",

Suddenly,\\nto my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he\\ncould towards me.\\n“ ‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come!

It was all done in\\nan instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me\\non the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most\\npreposterous position in which I ever found myself in\\nmy life, and it was the thought of it that started me\\nlaughing just now. It seems that there had been some\\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman\\nabsolutely refused to marry them without a witness\\nof some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the\\nbridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\\nsearch of a best man.

Now,” he said as he turned\\nhungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had\\nprovided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have\\nnot much time. It is nearly ﬁve now. In two hours\\nwe must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or\\nMadame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We\\nmust be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\\n“And what then?”\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already ar-\\nranged what is to occur. There is only one point on\\nwhich I must insist. You must not interfere, come\\nwhat may. You understand?”\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be\\nsome small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will\\nend in my being conveyed into the house. Four or\\nﬁve minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will\\nopen. You are to station yourself close to that open\\nwindow.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw\\ninto the room what I give you to throw, and will, at\\nthe same time, raise the cry of ﬁre. You quite follow\\nme?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking\\na long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an\\nordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, ﬁtted with a cap\\nat either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\nconﬁned to that. When you raise your cry of ﬁre, it\\nwill be taken up by quite a number of people. You\\nmay then walk to the end of the street, and I will\\nrejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\nmyself clear?”\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window,\\nto watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object,\\nthen to raise the cry of ﬁre, and to wait you at the\\ncorner of the street.”\\n“Precisely.”\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n“That is excellent.

His broad\\nblack hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympa-\\nthetic smile, and general look of peering and benevo-\\nlent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could\\nhave equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed\\nhis costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.\\nThe stage lost a ﬁne actor, even as science lost an acute\\nreasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street,\\nand it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we\\nfound ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already\\ndusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we\\npaced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting\\nfor the coming of its occupant. The house was just\\nsuch as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ suc-\\ncinct description, but the locality appeared to be less\\nprivate than I expected. On the contrary, for a small\\nstreet in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\\nanimated. There was a group of shabbily dressed\\nmen smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-\\ngrinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were\\nﬂirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed\\nyoung men who were lounging up and down with\\ncigars in their mouths.\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and\\nfro in front of the house, “this marriage rather sim-\\npliﬁes matters. The photograph becomes a double-\\nedged weapon now. The chances are that she would\\nbe as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Nor-\\nton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\\nprincess. Now the question is—Where are we to ﬁnd\\nthe photograph?”\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with\\nher. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment\\nabout a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is\\ncapable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may\\ntake it, then, that she does not carry it about with\\nher.”\\n“Where, then?”\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that dou-\\nble possibility. But I am inclined to think neither.\\nWomen are naturally secretive, and they like to do\\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over\\nto anyone else? She could trust her own guardian-\\nship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\\ninﬂuence might be brought to bear upon a business\\nman. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use\\nit within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\\nhands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n“But how will you look?”\\n“I will not look.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of\\nwheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders\\nto the letter.”\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a car-\\nriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a\\nsmart little landau which rattled up to the door of\\nBriony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loaﬁng\\nmen at the corner dashed forward to open the door\\nin the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed\\naway by another loafer, who had rushed up with the\\nsame intention. A ﬁerce quarrel broke out, which was\\nincreased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with\\none of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who\\nwas equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped\\nfrom her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of\\nﬂushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at\\neach other with their ﬁsts and sticks. Holmes dashed\\ninto the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he\\nreached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground,\\nwith the blood running freely down his face. At his\\nfall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direc-\\ntion and the loungers in the other, while a number of\\nbetter-dressed people, who had watched the scufﬂe\\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady\\nand to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will\\nstill call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood\\nat the top with her superb ﬁgure outlined against the\\nlights of the hall, looking back into the street.\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But\\nhe’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.”\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would\\nhave had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been\\nfor him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah,\\nhe’s breathing now.”\\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in,\\nmarm?”\\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room.

The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had\\nnot been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay\\nupon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized\\nwith compunction at that moment for the part he was\\nplaying, but I know that I never felt more heartily\\nashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the\\nbeautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or\\nthe grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\\nthe injured man. And yet it would be the blackest\\ntreachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part\\nwhich he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart,\\nand took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. Af-\\nter all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but\\npreventing her from injuring another.\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw\\nhim motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid\\nrushed across and threw open the window. At the\\nsame instant I saw him raise his hand and at the sig-\\nnal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of\\n“Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth\\nthan the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\nill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined\\nin a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke\\ncurled through the room and out at the open window.\\nI caught a glimpse of rushing ﬁgures, and a moment\\nlater the voice of Holmes from within assuring them\\nthat it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shout-\\ning crowd I made my way to the corner of the street,\\nand in ten minutes was rejoiced to ﬁnd my friend’s\\narm in mine, and to get away from the scene of up-\\nroar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few\\nminutes until we had turned down one of the quiet\\nstreets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked.\\n“Nothing could have been better. It is all right.”\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n“I know where it is.”\\n“And how did you ﬁnd out?”\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laugh-\\ning. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course,\\nsaw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.\\nThey were all engaged for the evening.”\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist\\nred paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward,\\nfell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became\\na piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have\\nme in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-\\nroom, which was the very room which I suspected.\\nIt lay between that and her bedroom, and I was de-\\ntermined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I\\nmotioned for air, they were compelled to open the\\nwindow, and you had your chance.”\\n“How did that help you?”\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that\\nher house is on ﬁre, her instinct is at once to rush\\nto the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly\\noverpowering impulse, and I have more than once\\ntaken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington\\nsubstitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\\nthe Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman\\ngrabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her\\njewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of\\nto-day had nothing in the house more precious to\\nher than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\nsecure it. The alarm of ﬁre was admirably done. The\\nsmoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of\\nsteel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is\\nin a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught\\na glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried\\nout that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced\\nat the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not\\nseen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, es-\\ncaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt\\nto secure the photograph at once; but the coachman\\nhad come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may\\nruin all.”\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n“Our quest is practically ﬁnished. I shall call with\\nthe King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come\\nwith us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to\\nwait for the lady, but it is probable that when she\\ncomes she may ﬁnd neither us nor the photograph. It\\nmight be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with\\nhis own hands.”\\n“And when will you call?”\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so\\nthat we shall have a clear ﬁeld. Besides, we must\\nbe prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King\\nwithout delay.”\\n13'),\n",

With an apology for my intrusion,\\nI was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me\\nabruptly into the room and closed the door behind\\nme.\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time,\\nmy dear Watson,” he said cordially.\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been\\nmy partner and helper in many of my most success-\\nful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the\\nutmost use to me in yours also.”\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and\\ngave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning\\nglance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his\\narmchair and putting his ﬁngertips together, as was\\nhis custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my dear\\nWatson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre\\nand outside the conventions and humdrum routine\\nof everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by\\nthe enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle,\\nand, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to\\nembellish so many of my own little adventures.”\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest inter-\\nest to me,” I observed.\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day,\\njust before we went into the very simple problem\\npresented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange\\neffects and extraordinary combinations we must go\\nto life itself, which is always far more daring than any\\neffort of the imagination.”\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubt-\\ning.”\\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come\\nround to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on pil-\\ning fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks\\ndown under them and acknowledges me to be right.\\nNow, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough\\nto call upon me this morning, and to begin a narra-\\ntive which promises to be one of the most singular\\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have\\nheard me remark that the strangest and most unique\\nthings are very often connected not with the larger\\nbut with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed,\\nwhere there is room for doubt whether any positive\\ncrime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is\\nimpossible for me to say whether the present case is\\nan instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever\\nlistened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have\\nthe great kindness to recommence your narrative. I\\nask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson\\nhas not heard the opening part but also because the\\npeculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have\\nevery possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when\\nI have heard some slight indication of the course of\\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of\\nother similar cases which occur to my memory. In the\\npresent instance I am forced to admit that the facts\\nare, to the best of my belief, unique.”\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an ap-\\npearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and\\nwrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his\\ngreatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement\\ncolumn, with his head thrust forward and the paper\\nﬂattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at\\nthe man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be\\npresented by his dress or appearance.\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspec-\\ntion. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average\\ncommonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous,\\nand slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s\\ncheck trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, un-\\nbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a\\nheavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit\\nof metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed\\ntop-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled\\nvelvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,\\nlook as I would, there was nothing remarkable about\\nthe man save his blazing red head, and the expression\\nof extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupa-\\ntion, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed\\nmy questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts\\nthat he has at some time done manual labour, that he\\ntakes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been\\nin China, and that he has done a considerable amount\\nof writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his\\nforeﬁnger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my com-\\npanion.\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know\\nall that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know,\\nfor example, that I did manual labour. It’s as true as\\ngospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\n19'),\n",

You will ﬁrst make a\\nnote, Doctor, of the paper and the date.”\\n“It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just\\ntwo months ago.”\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes,” said Jabez Wilson, mopping his\\nforehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s business at\\nCoburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large\\naffair, and of late years it has not done more than\\njust give me a living.

Spaulding, he came down into the ofﬁce just\\nthis day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand,\\nand he says:\\n“ ‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a\\nred-headed man.’\\n“ ‘Why that?’ I asks.\\n“ ‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the\\nLeague of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a\\nlittle fortune to any man who gets it, and I under-\\nstand that there are more vacancies than there are\\nmen, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what\\nto do with the money. If my hair would only change\\ncolour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step\\ninto.’\\n“ ‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr.\\nHolmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my\\nbusiness came to me instead of my having to go to\\nit, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot\\nover the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much\\nof what was going on outside, and I was always glad\\nof a bit of news.\\n“ ‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-\\nheaded Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.\\n“ ‘Never.’\\n“ ‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible your-\\nself for one of the vacancies.’\\n“ ‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\n“ ‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the\\nwork is slight, and it need not interfere very much\\nwith one’s other occupations.’\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me\\nprick up my ears, for the business has not been over-\\ngood for some years, and an extra couple of hundred\\nwould have been very handy.\\n“ ‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\n“ ‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement,\\n‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy,\\nand there is the address where you should apply for\\nparticulars. As far as I can make out, the League\\nwas founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah\\nHopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was\\nhimself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for\\nall red-headed men; so when he died it was found\\nthat he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of\\ntrustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the\\nproviding of easy berths to men whose hair is of that\\ncolour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very\\nlittle to do.’\\n“ ‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-\\nheaded men who would apply.’\\n“ ‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered.\\n‘You see it is really conﬁned to Londoners, and to\\ngrown men. This American had started from London\\nwhen he was young, and he wanted to do the old\\ntown a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no\\nuse your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red,\\nor anything but real bright, blazing, ﬁery red. Now, if\\nyou cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk\\nin; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while\\nto put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few\\nhundred pounds.’\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for\\nyourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint,\\nso that it seemed to me that if there was to be any\\ncompetition in the matter I stood as good a chance\\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding\\nseemed to know so much about it that I thought he\\nmight prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up\\nthe shutters for the day and to come right away with\\nme. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut\\nthe business up and started off for the address that\\nwas given us in the advertisement.\\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again,\\nMr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every\\nman who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped\\ninto the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street\\nwas choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court\\nlooked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not\\nhave thought there were so many in the whole coun-\\ntry as were brought together by that single adver-\\ntisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw,\\nlemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as\\nSpaulding said, there were not many who had the\\nreal vivid ﬂame-coloured tint. When I saw how many\\nwere waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could\\nnot imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted\\nuntil he got me through the crowd, and right up to\\nthe steps which led to the ofﬁce. There was a double\\nstream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and\\nsome coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well\\nas we could and soon found ourselves in the ofﬁce.”\\n“Your experience has been a most entertaining\\none,” remarked Holmes as his client paused and re-\\nfreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray\\ncontinue your very interesting statement.”\\n“There was nothing in the ofﬁce but a couple of\\nwooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a\\nsmall man with a head that was even redder than\\n21'),\n",

But we have\\nto be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs\\nand once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler’s\\nwax which would disgust you with human nature.’\\nHe stepped over to the window and shouted through\\nit at the top of his voice that the vacancy was ﬁlled.\\nA groan of disappointment came up from below, and\\nthe folk all trooped away in different directions until\\nthere was not a red-head to be seen except my own\\nand that of the manager.\\n“ ‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I\\nam myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left\\nby our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr.\\nWilson? Have you a family?’\\n“I answered that I had not.\\n“His face fell immediately.\\n“ ‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious\\nindeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund\\nwas, of course, for the propagation and spread of the\\nred-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is ex-\\nceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I\\nthought that I was not to have the vacancy after all;\\nbut after thinking it over for a few minutes he said\\nthat it would be all right.\\n“ ‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection\\nmight be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour\\nof a man with such a head of hair as yours. When\\nshall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n“ ‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business\\nalready,’ said I.\\n“ ‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said\\nVincent Spaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that\\nfor you.’\\n“ ‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\n“ ‘Ten to two.’\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of\\nan evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Fri-\\nday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would\\nsuit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Be-\\nsides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and\\nthat he would see to anything that turned up.\\n“ ‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the\\npay?’\\n“ ‘Is£4 a week.’\\n“ ‘And the work?’\\n“ ‘Is purely nominal.’\\n“ ‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\n“ ‘Well, you have to be in the ofﬁce, or at least\\nin the building, the whole time. If you leave, you\\nforfeit your whole position forever. The will is very\\nclear upon that point. You don’t comply with the\\nconditions if you budge from the ofﬁce during that\\ntime.’\\n“ ‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think\\nof leaving,’ said I.\\n“ ‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘nei-\\nther sickness nor business nor anything else. There\\nyou must stay, or you lose your billet.’\\n“ ‘And the work?’\\n“ ‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopaedia Britannica.”\\nThere is the ﬁrst volume of it in that press.

It cost\\nme something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly\\nﬁlled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly\\nthe whole business came to an end.”\\n“To an end?”\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went\\nto my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was\\nshut and locked, with a little square of cardboard\\nhammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.\\nHere it is, and you can read for yourself.”\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the\\nsize of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\\nThe Red-headed League\\nis\\nDissolved\\nOctober 9, 1890.\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt an-\\nnouncement and the rueful face behind it, until the\\ncomical side of the affair so completely overtopped\\nevery other consideration that we both burst out into\\na roar of laughter.\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,”\\ncried our client, ﬂushing up to the roots of his ﬂaming\\nhead. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at me,\\nI can go elsewhere.”\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the\\nchair from which he had half risen. “I really wouldn’t\\nmiss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly\\nunusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what\\nsteps did you take when you found the card upon the\\ndoor?”\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do.\\nThen I called at the ofﬁces round, but none of them\\nseemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went\\nto the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\nground-ﬂoor, and I asked him if he could tell me what\\nhad become of the Red-headed League. He said that\\nhe had never heard of any such body. Then I asked\\nhim who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that\\nthe name was new to him.\\n“ ‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No.4.’\\n“ ‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n“ ‘Yes.’\\n“ ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He\\nwas a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary\\nconvenience until his new premises were ready. He\\nmoved out yesterday.’\\n“ ‘Where could I ﬁnd him?’\\n“ ‘Oh, at his new ofﬁces. He did tell me the ad-\\ndress. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that\\naddress it was a manufactory of artiﬁcial knee-caps,\\nand no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William\\nMorris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took\\nthe advice of my assistant. But he could not help\\nme in any way. He could only say that if I waited\\nI should hear by post. But that was not quite good\\nenough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a\\nplace without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you\\nwere good enough to give advice to poor folk who\\nwere in need of it, I came right away to you.”\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your\\ncase is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be\\n23'),\n",

From what you have told me I\\nthink that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\nit than might at ﬁrst sight appear.”\\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I\\nhave lost four pound a week.”\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” re-\\nmarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any\\ngrievance against this extraordinary league. On the\\ncontrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30,\\nto say nothing of the minute knowledge which you\\nhave gained on every subject which comes under the\\nletter A.

Has a\\nwhite splash of acid upon his forehead.”\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excite-\\nment. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever\\nobserved that his ears are pierced for earrings?”\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for\\nhim when he was a lad.”\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep\\nthought. “He is still with you?”\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\n“And has your business been attended to in your\\nabsence?”\\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very\\nmuch to do of a morning.”\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give\\nyou an opinion upon the subject in the course of a\\nday or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by\\nMonday we may come to a conclusion.”\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had\\nleft us, “what do you make of it all?”\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a\\nmost mysterious business.”\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a\\nthing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your\\ncommonplace, featureless crimes which are really puz-\\nzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difﬁcult\\nto identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe\\nproblem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for\\nﬁfty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with\\nhis thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay\\npipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.\\nI had come to the conclusion that he had dropped\\nasleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he\\nsuddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of\\na man who has made up his mind and put his pipe\\ndown upon the mantelpiece.\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this after-\\nnoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson?\\nCould your patients spare you for a few hours?”\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never\\nvery absorbing.”\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going\\nthrough the City ﬁrst, and we can have some lunch\\non the way. I observe that there is a good deal of Ger-\\nman music on the programme, which is rather more\\nto my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective,\\nand I want to introspect. Come along!”\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Alders-\\ngate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square,\\nthe scene of the singular story which we had listened\\nto in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick\\nhouses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure,\\nwhere a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps\\nof faded laurel-bushes made a hard ﬁght against a\\nsmoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three\\ngilt balls and a brown board with “Jabez Wilson”\\nin white letters, upon a corner house, announced\\nthe place where our red-headed client carried on\\nhis business.

It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\\nclean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask\\nyou how you would go from here to the Strand.”\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant\\npromptly, closing the door.\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we\\nwalked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth\\nsmartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure\\nthat he has not a claim to be third. I have known\\nsomething of him before.”\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts\\nfor a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed\\nLeague. I am sure that you inquired your way merely\\nin order that you might see him.”\\n“Not him.”\\n“What then?”\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\n“And what did you see?”\\n“What I expected to see.”\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation,\\nnot for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We\\nknow something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now\\nexplore the parts which lie behind it.”\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we\\nturned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare presented as great a contrast to it as the front\\nof a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\narteries which conveyed the trafﬁc of the City to the\\nnorth and west. The roadway was blocked with the\\nimmense stream of commerce ﬂowing in a double tide\\ninward and outward, while the footpaths were black\\nwith the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difﬁ-\\ncult to realise as we looked at the line of ﬁne shops\\nand stately business premises that they really abutted\\non the other side upon the faded and stagnant square\\nwhich we had just quitted.\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner\\nand glancing along the line, “I should like just to re-\\nmember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of\\nmine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\nMortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop,\\nthe Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,\\nthe Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-\\nbuilding depot. That carries us right on to the other\\nblock. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s\\ntime we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of\\ncoffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweet-\\nness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being\\nhimself not only a very capable performer but a com-\\nposer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he\\nsat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happi-\\nness, gently waving his long, thin ﬁngers in time to\\nthe music, while his gently smiling face and his lan-\\nguid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes\\nthe sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to con-\\nceive. In his singular character the dual nature alter-\\nnately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and\\nastuteness represented, as I have often thought, the\\nreaction against the poetic and contemplative mood\\nwhich occasionally predominated in him. The swing\\nof his nature took him from extreme languor to de-\\nvouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so\\ntruly formidable as when, for days on end, he had\\nbeen lounging in his armchair amid his improvisa-\\ntions and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the\\nlust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and\\nthat his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the\\nlevel of intuition, until those who were unacquainted\\nwith his methods would look askance at him as on a\\nman whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.\\nWhen I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the\\nmusic at St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might\\nbe coming upon those whom he had set himself to\\nhunt down.\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he\\nremarked as we emerged.\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\n“And I have some business to do which will take\\nsome hours. This business at Coburg Square is seri-\\nous.”\\n“Why serious?”\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have\\nevery reason to believe that we shall be in time to\\nstop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates\\nmatters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\n“At what time?”\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\n“Very well.

As I drove\\nhome to my house in Kensington I thought over it\\nall, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed\\ncopier of the “Encyclopaedia” down to the visit to\\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with\\nwhich he had parted from me. What was this noctur-\\nnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where\\nwere we going, and what were we to do? I had the\\nhint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbro-\\nker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who\\nmight play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but\\ngave it up in despair and set the matter aside until\\nnight should bring an explanation.\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from\\nhome and made my way across the Park, and so\\nthrough Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms\\nwere standing at the door, and as I entered the pas-\\nsage I heard the sound of voices from above. On\\nentering his room I found Holmes in animated con-\\nversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as\\nPeter Jones, the ofﬁcial police agent, while the other\\nwas a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat\\nand oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, button-\\ning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting\\ncrop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr.\\nJones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to\\nMr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in\\nto-night’s adventure.”\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,”\\nsaid Jones in his consequential way. “Our friend here\\nis a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants\\nis an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end\\nof our chase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n“You may place considerable conﬁdence in Mr.\\nHolmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his\\nown little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my\\nsaying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but\\nhe has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too\\nmuch to say that once or twice, as in that business of\\nthe Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been\\nmore nearly correct than the ofﬁcial force.”\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said\\nthe stranger with deference. “Still, I confess that I\\nmiss my rubber. It is the ﬁrst Saturday night for\\nseven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rub-\\nber.”\\n“I think you will ﬁnd,” said Sherlock Holmes,\\n“that you will play for a higher stake to-night than\\nyou have ever done yet, and that the play will be more\\nexciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\\nsome £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man\\nupon whom you wish to lay your hands.”\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and\\nforger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but\\nhe is at the head of his profession, and I would rather\\nhave my bracelets on him than on any criminal in\\nLondon. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay.\\nHis grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has\\nbeen to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\\nhis ﬁngers, and though we meet signs of him at every\\nturn, we never know where to ﬁnd the man himself.\\nHe’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising\\nmoney to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nI’ve been on his track for years and have never set\\neyes on him yet.”\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introduc-\\ning you to-night. I’ve had one or two little turns also\\nwith Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at\\nthe head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and\\nquite time that we started. If you two will take the\\nﬁrst hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.”\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative dur-\\ning the long drive and lay back in the cab humming\\nthe tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We\\nrattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\nuntil we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked.\\n“This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and\\npersonally interested in the matter. I thought it as\\nwell to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow,\\nthough an absolute imbecile in his profession. He\\nhas one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog\\nand as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon\\nanyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare\\nin which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our\\ncabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of\\nMr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage\\nand through a side door, which he opened for us.\\nWithin there was a small corridor, which ended in a\\nvery massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led\\ndown a ﬂight of winding stone steps, which termi-\\nnated at another formidable gate.

A\\nfew seconds sufﬁced to satisfy him, for he sprang to\\nhis feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked,\\n“for they can hardly take any steps until the good\\npawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a\\nminute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\\ntime they will have for their escape. We are at present,\\nDoctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar\\nof the City branch of one of the principal London\\nbanks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why\\nthe more daring criminals of London should take a\\nconsiderable interest in this cellar at present.”\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director.\\n“We have had several warnings that an attempt might\\nbe made upon it.”\\n“Your French gold?”\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to\\nstrengthen our resources and borrowed for that pur-\\npose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to un-\\npack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.\\nThe crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons\\npacked between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of\\nbullion is much larger at present than is usually kept\\nin a single branch ofﬁce, and the directors have had\\nmisgivings upon the subject.”\\n“Which were very well justiﬁed,” observed\\nHolmes. “And now it is time that we arranged our\\nlittle plans. I expect that within an hour matters will\\ncome to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather,\\nwe must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in\\nmy pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie\\ncarr´ee, you might have your rubber after all. But I see\\nthat the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that\\nwe cannot risk the presence of a light. And, ﬁrst of\\nall, we must choose our positions. These are daring\\nmen, and though we shall take them at a disadvan-\\ntage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal\\nyourselves behind those. Then, when I ﬂash a light\\nupon them, close in swiftly. If they ﬁre, Watson, have\\nno compunction about shooting them down.”\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the\\nwooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot\\nthe slide across the front of his lantern and left us in\\npitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have\\nnever before experienced. The smell of hot metal re-\\nmained to assure us that the light was still there, ready\\nto ﬂash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my\\nnerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden\\ngloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes.\\n“That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg\\nSquare. I hope that you have done what I asked you,\\nJones?”\\n“I have an inspector and two ofﬁcers waiting at\\nthe front door.”\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we\\nmust be silent and wait.”\\nWhat a time it seemed!

Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it ap-\\npeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid\\nspark which marked a chink between the stones.\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary.\\nWith a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white\\nstones turned over upon its side and left a square,\\ngaping hole, through which streamed the light of\\na lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then,\\nwith a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself\\nshoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested\\nupon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side\\nof the hole and was hauling after him a companion,\\nlithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a\\nshock of very red hair.\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel\\nand the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and\\nI’ll swing for it!”\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the\\nintruder by the collar. The other dived down the\\nhole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones\\nclutched at his skirts. The light ﬂashed upon the\\nbarrel of a revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came\\ndown on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon\\nthe stone ﬂoor.\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You\\nhave no chance at all.”\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost\\ncoolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I\\nsee you have got his coat-tails.”\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,”\\nsaid Holmes.\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing\\nvery completely. I must compliment you.”\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed\\nidea was very new and effective.”\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones.\\n“He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just\\nhold out while I ﬁx the derbies.”\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your ﬁlthy\\nhands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clat-\\ntered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware that\\nI have royal blood in my veins.

He made\\na sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly\\noff in the custody of the detective.\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as\\nwe followed them from the cellar, “I do not know\\nhow the bank can thank you or repay you. There is\\nno doubt that you have detected and defeated in the\\nmost complete manner one of the most determined\\nattempts at bank robbery that have ever come within\\nmy experience.”\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own\\nto settle with Mr. John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have\\nbeen at some small expense over this matter, which\\nI shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I\\nam amply repaid by having had an experience which\\nis in many ways unique, and by hearing the very\\nremarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours\\nof the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and\\nsoda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious from\\nthe ﬁrst that the only possible object of this rather\\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League,\\nand the copying of the ‘Encyclopaedia,’ must be to\\nget this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way\\nfor a number of hours every day. It was a curious\\nway of managing it, but, really, it would be difﬁcult to\\nsuggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested\\nto Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accom-\\nplice’s hair. The £4 a week was a lure which must\\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing\\nfor thousands? They put in the advertisement, one\\nrogue has the temporary ofﬁce, the other rogue incites\\nthe man to apply for it, and together they manage to\\nsecure his absence every morning in the week. From\\nthe time that I heard of the assistant having come for\\nhalf wages, it was obvious to me that he had some\\nstrong motive for securing the situation.”\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\\n“Had there been women in the house, I should\\nhave suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however,\\nwas out of the question. The man’s business was a\\nsmall one, and there was nothing in his house which\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and\\nsuch an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\\nbe something out of the house. What could it be? I\\nthought of the assistant’s fondness for photography,\\nand his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar!\\nThere was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made\\ninquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found\\nthat I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something\\n28'),\n",

We would not dare to conceive\\nthe things which are really mere commonplaces of\\nexistence. If we could ﬂy out of that window hand\\nin hand, hover over this great city, gently remove\\nthe roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are\\ngoing on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,\\nthe cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events,\\nworking through generations, and leading to the most\\noutr´e results, it would make all ﬁction with its con-\\nventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\\nunproﬁtable.”\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered.\\n“The cases which come to light in the papers are, as\\na rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in\\nour police reports realism pushed to its extreme lim-\\nits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither\\nfascinating nor artistic.”\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in\\nproducing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This\\nis wanting in the police report, where more stress is\\nlaid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate\\nthan upon the details, which to an observer contain\\nthe vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it,\\nthere is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite un-\\nderstand your thinking so.” I said. “Of course, in\\nyour position of unofﬁcial adviser and helper to ev-\\nerybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three\\ncontinents, you are brought in contact with all that\\nis strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked up the\\nmorning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a\\npractical test. Here is the ﬁrst heading upon which I\\ncome. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half\\na column of print, but I know without reading it that\\nit is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course,\\nthe other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest\\nof writers could invent nothing more crude.”\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for\\nyour argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and\\nglancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas sep-\\naration case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in\\nclearing up some small points in connection with\\nit. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other\\nwoman, and the conduct complained of was that he\\nhad drifted into the habit of winding up every meal\\nby taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his\\nwife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to\\noccur to the imagination of the average story-teller.\\nTake a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I\\nhave scored over you in your example.”\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great\\namethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in\\nsuch contrast to his homely ways and simple life that\\nI could not help commenting upon it.\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you\\nfor some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King\\nof Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of\\nthe Irene Adler papers.”\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable\\nbrilliant which sparkled upon his ﬁnger.\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland,\\nthough the matter in which I served them was of\\nsuch delicacy that I cannot conﬁde it even to you,\\nwho have been good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my little problems.”\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked\\nwith interest.\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any\\nfeature of interest. They are important, you under-\\nstand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found\\nthat it is usually in unimportant matters that there is\\na ﬁeld for the observation, and for the quick analysis\\nof cause and effect which gives the charm to an inves-\\ntigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler,\\nfor the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is\\nthe motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles,\\nthere is nothing which presents any features of inter-\\nest. It is possible, however, that I may have something\\nbetter before very many minutes are over, for this is\\none of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing be-\\ntween the parted blinds gazing down into the dull\\nneutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoul-\\nder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood\\na large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,\\nand a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed\\nhat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of De-\\nvonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great\\npanoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fash-\\nion at our windows, while her body oscillated back-\\nward and forward, and her ﬁngers ﬁdgeted with her\\nglove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the\\nswimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the\\nroad, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes,\\nthrowing his cigarette into the ﬁre. “Oscillation upon\\nthe pavement always means an affaire de coeur .

Sherlock Holmes welcomed her\\nwith the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable,\\nand, having closed the door and bowed her into an\\narmchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet\\nabstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n“Do you not ﬁnd,” he said, “that with your short\\nsight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?”\\n“I did at ﬁrst,” she answered, “but now I know\\nwhere the letters are without looking.” Then, sud-\\ndenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave\\na violent start and looked up, with fear and astonish-\\nment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve\\nheard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how\\ncould you know all that?”\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my\\nbusiness to know things. Perhaps I have trained my-\\nself to see what others overlook. If not, why should\\nyou come to consult me?”\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from\\nMrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy\\nwhen the police and everyone had given him up for\\ndead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much\\nfor me. I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year\\nin my own right, besides the little that I make by the\\nmachine, and I would give it all to know what has\\nbecome of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a\\nhurry?” asked Sherlock Holmes, with his ﬁnger-tips\\ntogether and his eyes to the ceiling.\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vac-\\nuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang\\nout of the house,” she said, “for it made me angry\\nto see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that\\nis, my father—took it all. He would not go to the\\npolice, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as\\nhe would do nothing and kept on saying that there\\nwas no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on\\nwith my things and came right away to you.”\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather,\\nsurely, since the name is different.”\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it\\nsounds funny, too, for he is only ﬁve years and two\\nmonths older than myself.”\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best\\npleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon\\nafter father’s death, and a man who was nearly ﬁfteen\\nyears younger than herself. Father was a plumber in\\nthe Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business\\nbehind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy,\\nthe foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made\\nher sell the business, for he was very superior, being\\na traveller in wines. They got £4700 for the goodwill\\nand interest, which wasn’t near as much as father\\ncould have got if he had been alive.”\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient\\nunder this rambling and inconsequential narrative,\\nbut, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest\\nconcentration of attention.\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come\\nout of the business?”\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me\\nby my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand\\nstock, paying 41/2 per cent. Two thousand ﬁve hun-\\ndred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch\\nthe interest.”\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And\\nsince you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year,\\nwith what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt\\ntravel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I\\nbelieve that a single lady can get on very nicely upon\\nan income of about £60.”\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes,\\nbut you understand that as long as I live at home\\nI don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they\\nhave the use of the money just while I am staying\\nwith them. Of course, that is only just for the time.\\nMr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and\\npays it over to mother, and I ﬁnd that I can do pretty\\nwell with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me\\ntwopence a sheet, and I can often do from ﬁfteen to\\ntwenty sheets in a day.”\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,”\\nsaid Holmes. “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, be-\\nfore whom you can speak as freely as before myself.\\nKindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.”\\nA ﬂush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she\\npicked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “I met\\nhim ﬁrst at the gasﬁtters’ ball,” she said. “They used\\nto send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\n34'),\n",

He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help\\nit, and he used to say that a woman should be happy\\nin her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with,\\nand I had not got mine yet.”\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make\\nno attempt to see you?”\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a\\nweek, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be\\nsafer and better not to see each other until he had\\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used\\nto write every day. I took the letters in in the morning,\\nso there was no need for father to know.”\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the\\nﬁrst walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a\\ncashier in an ofﬁce in Leadenhall Street—and—”\\n“What ofﬁce?”\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\\n“Where did he live, then?”\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Ofﬁce, to be left till\\ncalled for. He said that if they were sent to the ofﬁce\\nhe would be chaffed by all the other clerks about hav-\\ning letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them,\\nlike he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said\\nthat when I wrote them they seemed to come from\\nme, but when they were typewritten he always felt\\nthat the machine had come between us. That will just\\nshow you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and\\nthe little things that he would think of.”\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has\\nlong been an axiom of mine that the little things are\\ninﬁnitely the most important. Can you remember any\\nother little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would\\nrather walk with me in the evening than in the day-\\nlight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very\\nretiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\ngentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when\\nhe was young, he told me, and it had left him with a\\nweak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of\\nspeech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and\\nhe wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank,\\nyour stepfather, returned to France?”\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and\\nproposed that we should marry before father came\\nback. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear,\\nwith my hands on the Testament, that whatever hap-\\npened I would always be true to him. Mother said\\nhe was quite right to make me swear, and that it was\\na sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\\nfrom the ﬁrst and was even fonder of him than I was.\\nThen, when they talked of marrying within the week,\\nI began to ask about father; but they both said never\\nto mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards,\\nand mother said she would make it all right with him.\\nI didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny\\nthat I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years\\nolder than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on\\nthe sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\ncompany has its French ofﬁces, but the letter came\\nback to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n35'),\n",

Your wedding was\\narranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St.\\nSaviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to have\\nbreakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer\\ncame for us in a hansom, but as there were two of\\nus he put us both into it and stepped himself into a\\nfour-wheeler, which happened to be the only other\\ncab in the street. We got to the church ﬁrst, and when\\nthe four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down\\nfrom the box and looked there was no one there! The\\ncabman said that he could not imagine what had be-\\ncome of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have\\nnever seen or heard anything since then to throw any\\nlight upon what became of him.”\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shame-\\nfully treated,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave\\nme so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that,\\nwhatever happened, I was to be true; and that even\\nif something quite unforeseen occurred to separate\\nus, I was always to remember that I was pledged to\\nhim, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or\\nlater. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning,\\nbut what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then,\\nthat some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to\\nhim?”\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or\\nelse he would not have talked so. And then I think\\nthat what he foresaw happened.”\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have\\nbeen?”\\n“None.”\\n“One more question. How did your mother take\\nthe matter?”\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak\\nof the matter again.”\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that some-\\nthing had happened, and that I should hear of Hos-\\nmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone\\nhave in bringing me to the doors of the church, and\\nthen leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money,\\nor if he had married me and got my money settled\\non him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\\nvery independent about money and never would look\\nat a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have hap-\\npened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives\\nme half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink\\nat night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her\\nmuff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes,\\nrising, “and I have no doubt that we shall reach some\\ndeﬁnite result.

You\\nwill ﬁnd parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\nAndover in ’77, and there was something of the sort\\nat The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,\\nthere were one or two details which were new to me.\\nBut the maiden herself was most instructive.”\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her\\nwhich was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not\\nknow where to look, and so you missed all that was\\nimportant. I can never bring you to realise the impor-\\ntance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or\\nthe great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now,\\nwhat did you gather from that woman’s appearance?\\nDescribe it.”\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed\\nstraw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket\\nwas black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe\\nof little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown,\\nrather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple\\nplush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish\\nand were worn through at the right foreﬁnger. Her\\nboots I didn’t observe. She had small round, hang-\\ning gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly\\nwell-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together\\nand chuckled.\\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along\\nwonderfully. You have really done very well indeed.\\nIt is true that you have missed everything of impor-\\ntance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\nhave a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general\\nimpressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon\\ndetails. My ﬁrst glance is always at a woman’s sleeve.\\nIn a man it is perhaps better ﬁrst to take the knee of\\nthe trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush\\nupon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for\\nshowing traces. The double line a little above the\\nwrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,\\nwas beautifully deﬁned. The sewing-machine, of the\\nhand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left\\narm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb,\\ninstead of being right across the broadest part, as\\nthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I\\nventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting,\\nwhich seemed to surprise her.”\\n“It surprised me.”\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much sur-\\nprised and interested on glancing down to observe\\nthat, though the boots which she was wearing were\\nnot unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the\\none having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other\\na plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower\\nbuttons out of ﬁve, and the other at the ﬁrst, third,\\nand ﬁfth. Now, when you see that a young lady, other-\\nwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with\\nodd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to\\nsay that she came away in a hurry.”\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I\\nalways was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note\\nbefore leaving home but after being fully dressed.\\nYou observed that her right glove was torn at the\\nforeﬁnger, but you did not apparently see that both\\nglove and ﬁnger were stained with violet ink. She\\nhad written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep.\\nIt must have been this morning, or the mark would\\nnot remain clear upon the ﬁnger. All this is amus-\\ning, though rather elementary, but I must go back to\\nbusiness, Watson. Would you mind reading me the\\nadvertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\n“Missing,” it said, “on the morning of\\nthe fourteenth, a gentleman named Hos-\\nmer Angel. About ﬁve ft. seven in. in\\nheight; strongly built, sallow complex-\\nion, black hair, a little bald in the cen-\\ntre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mous-\\ntache; tinted glasses, slight inﬁrmity of\\nspeech.

Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel,\\nsave that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remark-\\nable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten.\\nLook at the neat little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom.\\nThere is a date, you see, but no superscription except\\nLeadenhall Street, which is rather vague.

Once only had I\\nknown him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia\\nand of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked\\nback to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and\\nthe extraordinary circumstances connected with the\\nStudy in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle\\nindeed which he could not unravel.\\nI left him then, still pufﬁng at his black clay pipe,\\nwith the conviction that when I came again on the\\nnext evening I would ﬁnd that he held in his hands all\\nthe clues which would lead up to the identity of the\\ndisappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging\\nmy own attention at the time, and the whole of next\\nday I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was\\nnot until close upon six o’clock that I found myself\\nfree and was able to spring into a hansom and drive\\nto Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to\\nassist at the d ´enouement of the little mystery. I found\\nSherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with\\nhis long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\narmchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes,\\nwith the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid,\\ntold me that he had spent his day in the chemical\\nwork which was so dear to him.\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.\\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been\\nworking upon. There was never any mystery in the\\nmatter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details\\nare of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in\\ndeserting Miss Sutherland?”\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and\\nHolmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we\\nheard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the\\ndoor.\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James\\nWindibank,” said Holmes. “He has written to me\\nto say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized\\nfellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and\\nsallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner,\\nand a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey\\neyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us,\\nplaced his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and\\nwith a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said\\nHolmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is from\\nyou, in which you made an appointment with me for\\nsix o’clock?”\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I\\nam not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry\\nthat Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little\\nmatter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of\\nthe sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that\\nshe came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl,\\nas you may have noticed, and she is not easily con-\\ntrolled when she has made up her mind on a point.\\nOf course, I did not mind you so much, as you are\\nnot connected with the ofﬁcial police, but it is not\\npleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised\\nabroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could\\nyou possibly ﬁnd this Hosmer Angel?”\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have ev-\\nery reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering\\nMr. Hosmer Angel.”\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped\\nhis gloves. “I am delighted to hear it,” he said.\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a\\ntypewriter has really quite as much individuality as\\na man’s handwriting.

It was a considerable sum, for people in\\ntheir position, and the loss of it would have made a se-\\nrious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.\\nThe daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but\\naffectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\\nwas evident that with her fair personal advantages,\\nand her little income, she would not be allowed to\\nremain single long. Now her marriage would mean,\\nof course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does\\nher stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious\\ncourse of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\\nseek the company of people of her own age. But soon\\nhe found that that would not answer forever. She\\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and ﬁnally\\nannounced her positive intention of going to a certain\\nball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He\\nconceives an idea more creditable to his head than to\\nhis heart. With the connivance and assistance of his\\nwife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes\\nwith tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache\\nand a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice\\ninto an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on\\naccount of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr.\\nHosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making\\nlove himself.”\\n“It was only a joke at ﬁrst,” groaned our visitor.\\n“We never thought that she would have been so car-\\nried away.”\\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young\\nlady was very decidedly carried away, and, having\\nquite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant\\nentered her mind. She was ﬂattered by the gentle-\\nman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the\\nloudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr.\\nAngel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter\\nshould be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect\\nwere to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\nengagement, which would ﬁnally secure the girl’s\\naffections from turning towards anyone else. But the\\ndeception could not be kept up forever. These pre-\\ntended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end\\nin such a dramatic manner that it would leave a per-\\nmanent impression upon the young lady’s mind and\\nprevent her from looking upon any other suitor for\\nsome time to come. Hence those vows of ﬁdelity ex-\\nacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions\\nto a possibility of something happening on the very\\nmorning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel,\\n39'),\n",

The case has, in some respects, been not entirely\\ndevoid of interest.”\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your\\nreasoning,” I remarked.\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the ﬁrst that\\nthis Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object\\nfor his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that\\nthe only man who really proﬁted by the incident, as\\nfar as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact\\nthat the two men were never together, but that the\\none always appeared when the other was away, was\\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curi-\\nous voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the\\nbushy whiskers. My suspicions were all conﬁrmed\\nby his peculiar action in typewriting his signature,\\nwhich, of course, inferred that his handwriting was\\nso familiar to her that she would recognise even the\\nsmallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,\\ntogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the\\nsame direction.”\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to\\nget corroboration. I knew the ﬁrm for which this\\nman worked.

I had already\\nnoticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote\\nto the man himself at his business address asking him\\nif he would come here.

I shall take noth-\\ning for granted until I have the opportunity of looking\\npersonally into it. I will explain the state of things to\\nyou, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a\\nvery few words.\\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very\\nfar from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed\\nproprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made\\nhis money in Australia and returned some years ago\\nto the old country. One of the farms which he held,\\nthat of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy,\\nwho was also an ex-Australian. The men had known\\neach other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural\\nthat when they came to settle down they should do so\\nas near each other as possible. Turner was apparently\\nthe richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but\\nstill remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equal-\\nity, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had\\none son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only\\ndaughter of the same age, but neither of them had\\nwives living. They appear to have avoided the society\\nof the neighbouring English families and to have led\\nretired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of\\nsport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of\\nthe neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a\\nman and a girl. Turner had a considerable household,\\nsome half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I\\nhave been able to gather about the families. Now for\\nthe facts.\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy\\nleft his house at Hatherley about three in the after-\\nnoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which\\nis a small lake formed by the spreading out of the\\nstream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He\\nhad been out with his serving-man in the morning at\\nRoss, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as\\nhe had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\n“From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe\\nPool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as\\nhe passed over this ground.

Both these witnesses depose that Mr. Mc-\\nCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds\\nthat within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy\\npass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going\\nthe same way with a gun under his arm. To the best\\nof his belief, the father was actually in sight at the\\ntime, and the son was following him. He thought no\\nmore of the matter until he heard in the evening of\\nthe tragedy that had occurred.\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time\\nwhen William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of\\nthem. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round,\\nwith just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the\\nedge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the\\ndaughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley\\nestate, was in one of the woods picking ﬂowers. She\\nstates that while she was there she saw, at the border\\nof the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and\\nhis son, and that they appeared to be having a violent\\nquarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\\nstrong language to his son, and she saw the latter\\nraise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was\\nso frightened by their violence that she ran away and\\ntold her mother when she reached home that she had\\nleft the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe\\nPool, and that she was afraid that they were going to\\nﬁght. She had hardly said the words when young Mr.\\nMcCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he\\nhad found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for\\nthe help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,\\nwithout either his gun or his hat, and his right hand\\nand sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh\\nblood. On following him they found the dead body\\nstretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The\\nhead had been beaten in by repeated blows of some\\nheavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\\nmight very well have been inﬂicted by the butt-end\\nof his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass\\nwithin a few paces of the body. Under these circum-\\nstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a\\nverdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the\\ninquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought\\nbefore the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the\\ncase to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of\\nthe case as they came out before the coroner and the\\npolice-court.”\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I\\nremarked. “If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to\\na criminal it does so here.”\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,”\\nanswered Holmes thoughtfully. “It may seem to point\\nvery straight to one thing, but if you shift your own\\npoint of view a little, you may ﬁnd it pointing in an\\nequally uncompromising manner to something en-\\ntirely different. It must be confessed, however, that\\nthe case looks exceedingly grave against the young\\nman, and it is very possible that he is indeed the cul-\\nprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood,\\nhowever, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter\\nof the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom\\nyou may recollect in connection with the Study in\\nScarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade,\\nbeing rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and\\nhence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are ﬂy-\\ning westward at ﬁfty miles an hour instead of quietly\\ndigesting their breakfasts at home.”\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious\\nthat you will ﬁnd little credit to be gained out of this\\ncase.”\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvi-\\nous fact,” he answered, laughing. “Besides, we may\\nchance to hit upon some other obvious facts which\\nmay have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade.\\nYou know me too well to think that I am boasting\\nwhen I say that I shall either conﬁrm or destroy his\\ntheory by means which he is quite incapable of em-\\nploying, or even of understanding. To take the ﬁrst\\nexample to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your\\nbedroom the window is upon the right-hand side,\\nand yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\\n“How on earth—”\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the\\nmilitary neatness which characterises you. You shave\\nevery morning, and in this season you shave by the\\nsunlight; but since your shaving is less and less com-\\nplete as we get farther back on the left side, until it\\nbecomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle\\nof the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less\\nilluminated than the other. I could not imagine a man\\nof your habits looking at himself in an equal light\\nand being satisﬁed with such a result. I only quote\\nthis as a trivial example of observation and inference.\\nTherein lies my m´etier, and it is just possible that it\\nmay be of some service in the investigation which lies\\nbefore us. There are one or two minor points which\\nwere brought out in the inquest, and which are worth\\nconsidering.”\\n“What are they?”\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at\\nonce, but after the return to Hatherley Farm.

However\\ninnocent he might be, he could not be such an abso-\\nlute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were\\nvery black against him. Had he appeared surprised at\\nhis own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should\\nhave looked upon it as highly suspicious, because\\nsuch surprise or anger would not be natural under\\nthe circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best\\npolicy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the\\nsituation marks him as either an innocent man, or else\\nas a man of considerable self-restraint and ﬁrmness.\\nAs to his remark about his deserts, it was also not un-\\nnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead\\nbody of his father, and that there is no doubt that\\nhe had that very day so far forgotten his ﬁlial duty\\nas to bandy words with him, and even, according to\\nthe little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and\\ncontrition which are displayed in his remark appear\\nto me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of\\na guilty one.”\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged\\non far slighter evidence,” I remarked.\\n“So they have. And many men have been wrong-\\nfully hanged.”\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the\\nmatter?”\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his\\nsupporters, though there are one or two points in it\\nwhich are suggestive. You will ﬁnd it here, and may\\nread it for yourself.”\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local\\nHerefordshire paper, and having turned down the\\nsheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the un-\\nfortunate young man had given his own statement\\nof what had occurred. I settled myself down in the\\ncorner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran\\nin this way:\\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the de-\\nceased, was then called and gave evidence as\\nfollows: ‘I had been away from home for three\\ndays at Bristol, and had only just returned\\nupon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.\\nMy father was absent from home at the time\\nof my arrival, and I was informed by the maid\\nthat he had driven over to Ross with John\\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I\\nheard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,\\nlooking out of my window, I saw him get out\\nand walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was\\nnot aware in which direction he was going. I\\nthen took my gun and strolled out in the direc-\\ntion of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention\\nof visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the\\nother side. On my way I saw William Crow-\\nder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his\\nevidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that\\nI was following my father. I had no idea that\\nhe was in front of me. When about a hundred\\nyards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!”\\nwhich was a usual signal between my father\\nand myself. I then hurried forward, and found\\nhim standing by the pool. He appeared to be\\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me\\nrather roughly what I was doing there. A con-\\nversation ensued which led to high words and\\nalmost to blows, for my father was a man of\\na very violent temper. Seeing that his pas-\\nsion was becoming ungovernable, I left him\\nand returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had\\nnot gone more than 150 yards, however, when\\nI heard a hideous outcry behind me, which\\ncaused me to run back again. I found my fa-\\nther expiring upon the ground, with his head\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun and held\\nhim in my arms, but he almost instantly ex-\\npired. I knelt beside him for some minutes,\\nand then made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-\\nkeeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when\\nI returned, and I have no idea how he came by\\nhis injuries. He was not a popular man, being\\nsomewhat cold and forbidding in his manners,\\nbut he had, as far as I know, no active enemies.\\nI know nothing further of the matter.’\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any\\nstatement to you before he died?\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I\\ncould only catch some allusion to a rat.\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by\\n45'),\n",

He calls attention, and with\\nreason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal\\nto give details of his conversation with his father, and\\nhis singular account of his father’s dying words. They\\nare all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched\\nhimself out upon the cushioned seat. “Both you and\\nthe coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to sin-\\ngle out the very strongest points in the young man’s\\nfavour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him\\ncredit for having too much imagination and too little?\\nToo little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel\\nwhich would give him the sympathy of the jury; too\\nmuch, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness\\nanything so outr ´e as a dying reference to a rat, and\\nthe incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall\\napproach this case from the point of view that what\\nthis young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my\\npocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of\\nthis case until we are on the scene of action.

A lean, ferret-like\\nman, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon\\nthe platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and\\nleather-leggings which he wore in deference to his\\nrustic surroundings, I had no difﬁculty in recognising\\nLestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to\\nthe Hereford Arms where a room had already been\\nengaged for us.\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we\\nsat over a cup of tea. “I knew your energetic nature,\\nand that you would not be happy until you had been\\non the scene of the crime.”\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,”\\nHolmes answered. “It is entirely a question of baro-\\nmetric pressure.”\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,”\\nhe said.\\n46'),\n",

Her violet eyes shining, her\\nlips parted, a pink ﬂush upon her cheeks, all thought\\nof her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excite-\\nment and concern.\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing\\nfrom one to the other of us, and ﬁnally, with a\\nwoman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my com-\\npanion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have\\ndriven down to tell you so. I know that James didn’t\\ndo it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your\\nwork knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\\nthat point. We have known each other since we were\\nlittle children, and I know his faults as no one else\\ndoes; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a ﬂy. Such\\na charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sher-\\nlock Holmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I\\ncan.”\\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed\\nsome conclusion? Do you not see some loophole,\\nsome ﬂaw? Do you not yourself think that he is inno-\\ncent?”\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head\\nand looking deﬁantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He\\ngives me hopes.”\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that\\nmy colleague has been a little quick in forming his\\nconclusions,” he said.\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James\\nnever did it. And about his quarrel with his father,\\nI am sure that the reason why he would not speak\\nabout it to the coroner was because I was concerned\\nin it.”\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and\\nhis father had many disagreements about me. Mr. Mc-\\nCarthy was very anxious that there should be a mar-\\nriage between us. James and I have always loved each\\nother as brother and sister; but of course he is young\\nand has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well,\\nhe naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet.\\nSo there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one\\nof them.”\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in\\nfavour of such a union?”\\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr.\\nMcCarthy was in favour of it.” A quick blush passed\\nover her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his\\nkeen, questioning glances at her.\\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I\\nsee your father if I call to-morrow?”\\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\\n“The doctor?”\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never\\nbeen strong for years back, but this has broken him\\ndown completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr.\\nWillows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous\\nsystem is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man\\nalive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.”\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I under-\\nstand, Mr. Turner made his money.”\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of mate-\\nrial assistance to me.”\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.\\nNo doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh,\\nif you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to\\nbe innocent.”\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he\\nmisses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help\\nyou in your undertaking.” She hurried from the room\\nas impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade\\nwith dignity after a few minutes’ silence. “Why\\nshould you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint?

We have still time to take a train to Hereford\\nand see him to-night?”\\n“Ample.”\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will\\nﬁnd it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of\\nhours.”\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then\\nwandered through the streets of the little town, ﬁnally\\nreturning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and\\ntried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The\\npuny plot of the story was so thin, however, when\\ncompared to the deep mystery through which we\\nwere groping, and I found my attention wander so\\ncontinually from the action to the fact, that I at last\\nﬂung it across the room and gave myself up entirely\\nto a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing\\nthat this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely\\ntrue, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unfore-\\nseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred\\nbetween the time when he parted from his father, and\\nthe moment when, drawn back by his screams, he\\nrushed into the glade? It was something terrible and\\ndeadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I\\nrang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\\nwhich contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In\\nthe surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the poste-\\nrior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of\\nthe occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow\\nfrom a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my\\nown head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck\\nfrom behind. That was to some extent in favour of the\\naccused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face\\nwith his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for\\nthe older man might have turned his back before the\\nblow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’\\nattention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying ref-\\nerence to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be\\ndelirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not\\ncommonly become delirious. No, it was more likely\\nto be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But\\nwhat could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to ﬁnd\\nsome possible explanation. And then the incident of\\nthe grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were\\ntrue the murderer must have dropped some part of\\nhis dress, presumably his overcoat, in his ﬂight, and\\nmust have had the hardihood to return and to carry\\nit away at the instant when the son was kneeling with\\nhis back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue\\nof mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was!\\nI did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had\\nso much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could\\nnot lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to\\nstrengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s inno-\\ncence.\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He\\ncame back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings\\nin the town.\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as\\nhe sat down. “It is of importance that it should not\\nrain before we are able to go over the ground. On\\nthe other hand, a man should be at his very best and\\nkeenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish\\nto do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen\\nyoung McCarthy.”\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Could he throw no light?”\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time\\nthat he knew who had done it and was screening him\\nor her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled\\nas everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\\nthough comely to look at and, I should think, sound\\nat heart.”\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is\\nindeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so\\ncharming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This\\nfellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some\\ntwo years ago, when he was only a lad, and before\\nhe really knew her, for she had been away ﬁve years\\nat a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get\\ninto the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry\\nher at a registry ofﬁce? No one knows a word of\\nthe matter, but you can imagine how maddening it\\nmust be to him to be upbraided for not doing what\\nhe would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows\\nto be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of\\nthis sort which made him throw his hands up into\\nthe air when his father, at their last interview, was\\ngoading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the\\nother hand, he had no means of supporting himself,\\nand his father, who was by all accounts a very hard\\nman, would have thrown him over utterly had he\\nknown the truth.

I would call your attention very partic-\\nularly to two points. One is that the murdered man\\nhad an appointment with someone at the pool, and\\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his\\nson was away, and he did not know when he would\\nreturn. The second is that the murdered man was\\nheard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had\\nreturned. Those are the crucial points upon which\\nthe case depends. And now let us talk about George\\nMeredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor\\nmatters until to-morrow.”\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and\\nthe morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine\\no’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade\\nobserved. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so\\nill that his life is despaired of.”\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shat-\\ntered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing\\nhealth for some time. This business has had a very\\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of Mc-\\nCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him,\\nfor I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\\nrent free.”\\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped\\nhim. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to\\nhim.”\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular\\nthat this McCarthy, who appears to have had little\\nof his own, and to have been under such obligations\\nto Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to\\nTurner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the\\nestate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if\\nit were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that\\nTurner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter\\ntold us as much. Do you not deduce something from\\nthat?”\\n“We have got to the deductions and the infer-\\nences,” said Lestrade, winking at me. “I ﬁnd it hard\\nenough to tackle facts, Holmes, without ﬂying away\\nafter theories and fancies.”\\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do\\nﬁnd it very hard to tackle the facts.”\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem\\nto ﬁnd it difﬁcult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with\\nsome warmth.\\n“And that is—”\\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from Mc-\\nCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are\\nthe merest moonshine.”\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,”\\nsaid Holmes, laughing. “But I am very much mis-\\ntaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-\\nlooking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great\\nyellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The\\ndrawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this\\nhorror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,\\nwhen the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the\\nboots which her master wore at the time of his death,\\nand also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which\\nhe had then had. Having measured these very care-\\nfully from seven or eight different points, Holmes\\ndesired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all\\nfollowed the winding track which led to Boscombe\\nPool.\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was\\nhot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only\\nknown the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street\\nwould have failed to recognise him. His face ﬂushed\\nand darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard\\nblack lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath\\nthem with a steely glitter. His face was bent down-\\nward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and\\nthe veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy\\nneck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely ani-\\nmal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely\\nconcentrated upon the matter before him that a ques-\\ntion or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the\\nmost, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.\\nSwiftly and silently he made his way along the track\\nwhich ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\\nwoods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy\\nground, as is all that district, and there were marks\\nof many feet, both upon the path and amid the short\\ngrass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes\\nHolmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and\\nonce he made quite a little detour into the meadow.\\n49'),\n",

Above the woods\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the\\nred, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the\\nrich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of\\nthe pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\\nbetween the edge of the trees and the reeds which\\nlined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot\\nat which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the\\ntraces which had been left by the fall of the stricken\\nman. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and\\npeering eyes, very many other things were to be read\\nupon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog\\nwho is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my\\ncompanion.\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\n“I ﬁshed about with a rake. I thought there might\\nbe some weapon or other trace. But how on earth—”\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of\\nyours with its inward twist is all over the place. A\\nmole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the\\nreeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had\\nI been here before they came like a herd of buffalo\\nand wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered\\nall tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But\\nhere are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He\\ndrew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof\\nto have a better view, talking all the time rather to\\nhimself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet.\\nTwice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so\\nthat the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly\\nvisible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw\\nhis father on the ground. Then here are the father’s\\nfeet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It\\nis the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening.\\nAnd this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tip-\\ntoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come,\\nthey go, they come again—of course that was for the\\ncloak. Now where did they come from?” He ran up\\nand down, sometimes losing, sometimes ﬁnding the\\ntrack until we were well within the edge of the wood\\nand under the shadow of a great beech, the largest\\ntree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way\\nto the farther side of this and lay down once more\\nupon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a\\nlong time he remained there, turning over the leaves\\nand dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me\\nto be dust into an envelope and examining with his\\nlens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree\\nas far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying\\namong the moss, and this also he carefully examined\\nand retained. Then he followed a pathway through\\nthe wood until he came to the highroad, where all\\ntraces were lost.\\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he\\nremarked, returning to his natural manner. “I fancy\\nthat this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I\\nthink that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\\nand perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we\\nmay drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the\\ncab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our\\ncab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying\\nwith him the stone which he had picked up in the\\nwood.\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked,\\nholding it out. “The murder was done with it.”\\n“I see no marks.”\\n“There are none.”\\n“How do you know, then?”\\n“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain\\nthere a few days. There was no sign of a place whence\\nit had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries.\\nThere is no sign of any other weapon.”\\n“And the murderer?”\\n“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right\\nleg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak,\\nsmokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries\\na blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several\\nother indications, but these may be enough to aid us\\nin our search.”\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a\\nsceptic,” he said. “Theories are all very well, but we\\nhave to deal with a hard-headed British jury.”\\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You\\nwork your own method, and I shall work mine. I\\nshall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably re-\\nturn to London by the evening train.”\\n“And leave your case unﬁnished?”\\n“No, ﬁnished.”\\n“But the mystery?”\\n“It is solved.”\\n50'),\n",

This\\nis not such a populous neighbourhood.”\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical\\nman,” he said, “and I really cannot undertake to go\\nabout the country looking for a left-handed gentleman\\nwith a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock\\nof Scotland Yard.”\\n“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given\\nyou the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I\\nshall drop you a line before I leave.”\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our\\nhotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes\\nwas silent and buried in thought with a pained ex-\\npression upon his face, as one who ﬁnds himself in a\\nperplexing position.\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was\\ncleared “just sit down in this chair and let me preach\\nto you for a little. I don’t know quite what to do, and\\nI should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\\nexpound.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are\\ntwo points about young McCarthy’s narrative which\\nstruck us both instantly, although they impressed me\\nin his favour and you against him. One was the fact\\nthat his father should, according to his account, cry\\n‘Cooee!’ before seeing him. The other was his singular\\ndying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words,\\nyou understand, but that was all that caught the son’s\\near. Now from this double point our research must\\ncommence, and we will begin it by presuming that\\nwhat the lad says is absolutely true.”\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for\\nthe son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol.\\nIt was mere chance that he was within earshot. The\\n‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever\\nit was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’\\nis a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used\\nbetween Australians. There is a strong presumption\\nthat the person whom McCarthy expected to meet\\nhim at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in\\nAustralia.”\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his\\npocket and ﬂattened it out on the table. “This is a\\nmap of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to\\nBristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of\\nthe map. “What do you read?”\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\n“BALLARAT.”\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered,\\nand of which his son only caught the last two sylla-\\nbles. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.\\nSo and so, of Ballarat.”\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\n“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed\\nthe ﬁeld down considerably. The possession of a grey\\ngarment was a third point which, granting the son’s\\nstatement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\\nnow out of mere vagueness to the deﬁnite conception\\nof an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“And one who was at home in the district, for the\\npool can only be approached by the farm or by the\\nestate, where strangers could hardly wander.”\\n“Quite so.”\\n“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an ex-\\namination of the ground I gained the triﬂing details\\nwhich I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the per-\\nsonality of the criminal.”\\n“But how did you gain them?”\\n“You know my method. It is founded upon the\\nobservation of triﬂes.”\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge\\nfrom the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be\\ntold from their traces.”\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\n“But his lameness?”\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less\\ndistinct than his left. He put less weight upon it.\\nWhy? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the\\ninjury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The\\nblow was struck from immediately behind, and yet\\nwas upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless\\nit were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\\nthat tree during the interview between the father and\\nson. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a\\ncigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes\\nenables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar.

His tangled beard,\\ngrizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows\\ncombined to give an air of dignity and power to his\\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while\\nhis lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged\\nwith a shade of blue.

I give you my word that I would\\nhave spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes\\ngravely.\\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my\\ndear girl.

Young McCarthy must be\\ngot off, however.”\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had\\ndiabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question\\nwhether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die\\nunder my own roof than in a jail.”\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his\\npen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him.\\n“Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the\\nfacts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness\\nit. Then I could produce your confession at the last\\nextremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that\\nI shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question\\nwhether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little\\nto me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock.\\nAnd now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me\\nlong to tell.\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy.

In a word, I turned over\\na new leaf and did my best to make up for the past.\\nAll was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon\\nme.\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and\\nI met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his\\nback or a boot to his foot.\\n“ ‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the\\narm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two\\nof us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping\\nof us. If you don’t—it’s a ﬁne, law-abiding country is\\nEngland, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’\\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there\\nwas no shaking them off, and there they have lived\\nrent free on my best land ever since. There was no\\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where\\nI would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my\\nelbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon\\nsaw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than\\nof the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and\\nwhatever it was I gave him without question, land,\\nmoney, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I\\ncould not give. He asked for Alice.\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my\\ngirl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it\\nseemed a ﬁne stroke to him that his lad should step\\ninto the whole property. But there I was ﬁrm. I would\\nnot have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that\\nI had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in\\nhim, and that was enough. I stood ﬁrm. McCarthy\\nthreatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to\\nmeet at the pool midway between our houses to talk\\nit over.\\n“When I went down there I found him talking\\nwith his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind\\na tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed\\nto come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry\\nmy daughter with as little regard for what she might\\nthink as if she were a slut from off the streets. It\\ndrove me mad to think that I and all that I held most\\ndear should be in the power of such a man as this.\\nCould I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and\\na desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly\\nstrong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.\\nBut my memory and my girl! Both could be saved\\nif I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr.\\nHolmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,\\nI have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But\\nthat my girl should be entangled in the same meshes\\nwhich held me was more than I could suffer. I struck\\nhim down with no more compunction than if he had\\nbeen some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought\\nback his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood,\\nthough I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak\\nwhich I had dropped in my ﬂight. That is the true\\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes\\nas the old man signed the statement which had been\\ndrawn out. “I pray that we may never be exposed to\\nsuch a temptation.”\\n“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”\\n“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself\\naware that you will soon have to answer for your deed\\nat a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your\\nconfession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be\\nforced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal\\neye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead,\\nshall be safe with us.”\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your\\nown deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier\\nfor the thought of the peace which you have given to\\nmine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame,\\nhe stumbled slowly from the room.\\n“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence.\\n“Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless\\nworms?

Some, however, have already\\ngained publicity through the papers, and others have\\nnot offered a ﬁeld for those peculiar qualities which\\nmy friend possessed in so high a degree, and which\\nit is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\\ntoo, have bafﬂed his analytical skill, and would be,\\nas narratives, beginnings without an ending, while\\nothers have been but partially cleared up, and have\\ntheir explanations founded rather upon conjecture\\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which\\nwas so dear to him. There is, however, one of these\\nlast which was so remarkable in its details and so\\nstartling in its results that I am tempted to give some\\naccount of it in spite of the fact that there are points\\nin connection with it which never have been, and\\nprobably never will be, entirely cleared up.\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of\\ncases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the\\nrecords. Among my headings under this one twelve\\nmonths I ﬁnd an account of the adventure of the\\nParadol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society,\\nwho held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the\\nloss of the British barque “Sophy Anderson”, of the\\nsingular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the is-\\nland of Uffa, and ﬁnally of the Camberwell poisoning\\ncase. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock\\nHolmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours\\nbefore, and that therefore the deceased had gone to\\nbed within that time—a deduction which was of the\\ngreatest importance in clearing up the case. All these\\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of\\nthem present such singular features as the strange\\ntrain of circumstances which I have now taken up my\\npen to describe.\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the\\nequinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence.\\nAll day the wind had screamed and the rain had\\nbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the\\nheart of great, hand-made London we were forced\\nto raise our minds for the instant from the routine\\nof life and to recognise the presence of those great\\nelemental forces which shriek at mankind through\\nthe bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a\\ncage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and\\nlouder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in\\nthe chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side\\nof the ﬁreplace cross-indexing his records of crime,\\nwhile I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell’s\\nﬁne sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without\\nseemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea\\nwaves. My wife was on a visit to her mother’s, and\\nfor a few days I was a dweller once more in my old\\nquarters at Baker Street.\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that\\nwas surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some\\nfriend of yours, perhaps?”\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do\\nnot encourage visitors.”\\n“A client, then?”\\n“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would\\nbring a man out on such a day and at such an hour.\\nBut I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of\\nthe landlady’s.”\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture,\\nhowever, for there came a step in the passage and\\na tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm\\nto turn the lamp away from himself and towards the\\nvacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\\n“Come in!” said he.\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-\\ntwenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad,\\nwith something of reﬁnement and delicacy in his\\nbearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in\\nhis hand, and his long shining waterproof told of\\nthe ﬁerce weather through which he had come. He\\nlooked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp,\\nand I could see that his face was pale and his eyes\\nheavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with\\nsome great anxiety.\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden\\npince-nez to his eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding.\\nI fear that I have brought some traces of the storm\\nand rain into your snug chamber.”\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes.\\n“They may rest here on the hook and will be dry\\npresently. You have come up from the south-west, I\\nsee.”\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon\\nyour toe caps is quite distinctive.”\\n“I have come for advice.”\\n“That is easily got.”\\n“And help.”\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\n57'),\n",

It is a hereditary matter;\\nso in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go\\nback to the commencement of the affair.\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two\\nsons—my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My fa-\\nther had a small factory at Coventry, which he en-\\nlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He\\nwas a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and\\nhis business met with such success that he was able\\nto sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he\\nwas a young man and became a planter in Florida,\\nwhere he was reported to have done very well. At\\nthe time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and\\nafterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel.\\nWhen Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to\\nhis plantation, where he remained for three or four\\nyears. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe\\nand took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He\\nhad made a very considerable fortune in the States,\\nand his reason for leaving them was his aversion to\\nthe negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy\\nin extending the franchise to them. He was a singular\\nman, ﬁerce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed\\nwhen he was angry, and of a most retiring disposi-\\ntion. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I\\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden\\nand two or three ﬁelds round his house, and there he\\nwould take his exercise, though very often for weeks\\non end he would never leave his room. He drank a\\ngreat deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he\\nwould see no society and did not want any friends,\\nnot even his own brother.\\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me,\\nfor at the time when he saw me ﬁrst I was a young-\\nster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878,\\nafter he had been eight or nine years in England. He\\nbegged my father to let me live with him and he was\\nvery kind to me in his way. When he was sober he\\nused to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts\\nwith me, and he would make me his representative\\nboth with the servants and with the tradespeople, so\\nthat by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master\\nof the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I\\nliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb\\nhim in his privacy. There was one singular exception,\\nhowever, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up\\namong the attics, which was invariably locked, and\\nwhich he would never permit either me or anyone\\nelse to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped\\nthrough the keyhole, but I was never able to see more\\nthan such a collection of old trunks and bundles as\\nwould be expected in such a room.\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with\\na foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the\\ncolonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him\\nto receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready\\nmoney, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From In-\\ndia!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark!\\nWhat can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there\\njumped ﬁve little dried orange pips, which pattered\\ndown upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but\\nthe laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his\\nface. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope\\nwhich he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’\\nhe shrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins\\nhave overtaken me!’\\n“ ‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\n58'),\n",

There was nothing else save\\nthe ﬁve dried pips. What could be the reason of his\\noverpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as\\nI ascended the stair I met him coming down with an\\nold rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic,\\nin one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in\\nthe other.\\n“ ‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate\\nthem still,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I\\nshall want a ﬁre in my room to-day, and send down\\nto Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived\\nI was asked to step up to the room. The ﬁre was\\nburning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of\\nblack, ﬂuffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\\nbox stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at\\nthe box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was\\nprinted the treble K which I had read in the morning\\nupon the envelope.\\n“ ‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my\\nwill. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all\\nits disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence\\nit will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in\\npeace, well and good! If you ﬁnd you cannot, take my\\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy.\\nI am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I\\ncan’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly\\nsign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer\\ntook it away with him. The singular incident made,\\nas you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in\\nmy mind without being able to make anything of it.\\nYet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread\\nwhich it left behind, though the sensation grew less\\nkeen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to\\ndisturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a\\nchange in my uncle, however. He drank more than\\never, and he was less inclined for any sort of society.\\nMost of his time he would spend in his room, with the\\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would\\nemerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst\\nout of the house and tear about the garden with a\\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid\\nof no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like\\na sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot\\nﬁts were over, however, he would rush tumultuously\\nin at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like\\na man who can brazen it out no longer against the\\nterror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times\\nI have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with\\nmoisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes,\\nand not to abuse your patience, there came a night\\nwhen he made one of those drunken sallies from\\nwhich he never came back. We found him, when\\nwe went to search for him, face downward in a lit-\\ntle green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the\\ngarden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having\\nregard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict\\nof ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from\\nthe very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The\\nmatter passed, however, and my father entered into\\npossession of the estate, and of some £14,000, which\\nlay to his credit at the bank.”\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your state-\\nment is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to\\nwhich I have ever listened. Let me have the date of\\nthe reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date\\nof his supposed suicide.”\\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death\\nwas seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.”\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property,\\nhe, at my request, made a careful examination of the\\nattic, which had been always locked up. We found\\nthe brass box there, although its contents had been\\ndestroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper la-\\nbel, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\\n‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written\\nbeneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature\\nof the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel\\nOpenshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much\\nimportance in the attic save a great many scattered\\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life\\nin America. Some of them were of the war time and\\nshowed that he had done his duty well and had borne\\nthe repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date\\nduring the reconstruction of the Southern states, and\\nwere mostly concerned with politics, for he had evi-\\ndently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag\\npoliticians who had been sent down from the North.\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father\\ncame to live at Horsham, and all went as well as pos-\\nsible with us until the January of ’85. On the fourth\\nday after the new year I heard my father give a sharp\\ncry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-\\ntable. There he was, sitting with a newly opened\\n59'),\n",

K. K.,’ said\\nI.\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried.\\n‘Here are the very letters.

Where does the thing come\\nfrom?’\\n“ ‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the post-\\nmark.\\n“ ‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he.\\n‘What have I to do with sundials and papers?

Nothing of the\\nsort.’\\n“ ‘Then let me do so?’\\n“ ‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about\\nsuch nonsense.’\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a\\nvery obstinate man. I went about, however, with a\\nheart which was full of forebodings.\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter\\nmy father went from home to visit an old friend of\\nhis, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the\\nforts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should\\ngo, for it seemed to me that he was farther from dan-\\nger when he was away from home. In that, however,\\nI was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I\\nreceived a telegram from the major, imploring me to\\ncome at once. My father had fallen over one of the\\ndeep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood,\\nand was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hur-\\nried to him, but he passed away without having ever\\nrecovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears,\\nbeen returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as\\nthe country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a\\nverdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully\\nas I examined every fact connected with his death, I\\nwas unable to ﬁnd anything which could suggest the\\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no\\nfootmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having\\nbeen seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you\\nthat my mind was far from at ease, and that I was\\nwell-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven\\nround him.\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance.\\nYou will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer,\\nbecause I was well convinced that our troubles were\\nin some way dependent upon an incident in my un-\\ncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in\\none house as in another.\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his\\nend, and two years and eight months have elapsed\\nsince then. During that time I have lived happily at\\nHorsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had\\npassed away from the family, and that it had ended\\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort\\ntoo soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in\\nthe very shape in which it had come upon my father.”\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crum-\\npled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out\\nupon it ﬁve little dried orange pips.\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The post-\\nmark is London—eastern division. Within are the\\nvery words which were upon my father’s last mes-\\nsage: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the\\nsundial.’ ”\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin,\\nwhite hands—“I have felt helpless. I have felt like\\none of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing\\ntowards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless,\\ninexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions\\ncan guard against.”\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act,\\nman, or you are lost.

Who is this K. K.

As Cuvier could correctly de-\\nscribe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single\\nbone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood\\none link in a series of incidents should be able to ac-\\ncurately state all the other ones, both before and after.\\nWe have not yet grasped the results which the reason\\nalone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the\\nstudy which have bafﬂed all those who have sought\\na solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art,\\nhowever, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the\\nreasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which\\nhave come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies,\\nas you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge,\\nwhich, even in these days of free education and ency-\\nclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is\\nnot so impossible, however, that a man should possess\\nall knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in\\nhis work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to\\ndo. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the\\nearly days of our friendship, deﬁned my limits in a\\nvery precise fashion.”\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular\\ndocument. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were\\nmarked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geol-\\nogy profound as regards the mud-stains from any\\nregion within ﬁfty miles of town, chemistry eccen-\\ntric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and\\ncrime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swords-\\nman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\\nThose, I think, were the main points of my analysis.”\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said,\\n“I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his\\nlittle brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he\\nis likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the\\nlumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he\\nwants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has\\nbeen submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to\\nmuster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the\\nletter K of the ‘American Encyclopaedia’ which stands\\nupon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us\\nconsider the situation and see what may be deduced\\nfrom it. In the ﬁrst place, we may start with a strong\\npresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very\\nstrong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of\\nlife do not change all their habits and exchange will-\\ningly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely\\nlife of an English provincial town. His extreme love\\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was\\nin fear of someone or something, so we may assume\\nas a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone\\nor something which drove him from America. As\\nto what it was he feared, we can only deduce that\\nby considering the formidable letters which were re-\\nceived by himself and his successors. Did you remark\\nthe postmarks of those letters?”\\n“The ﬁrst was from Pondicherry, the second from\\nDundee, and the third from London.”\\n“From East London. What do you deduce from\\nthat?”\\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on\\nboard of a ship.”\\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be\\nno doubt that the probability—the strong probabil-\\nity—is that the writer was on board of a ship. And\\nnow let us consider another point. In the case of\\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat\\nand its fulﬁlment, in Dundee it was only some three\\nor four days. Does that suggest anything?”\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to\\ncome.”\\n“Then I do not see the point.”\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in\\nwhich the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as\\nif they always send their singular warning or token be-\\nfore them when starting upon their mission. You see\\nhow quickly the deed followed the sign when it came\\n62'),\n",

I think that it is quite clear that\\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man\\ncould not have carried out two deaths in such a way\\nas to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have been\\nseveral in it, and they must have been men of resource\\nand determination. Their papers they mean to have,\\nbe the holder of them who it may. In this way you see\\nK. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and\\nbecomes the badge of a society.”\\n“But of what society?”\\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bend-\\ning forward and sinking his voice—“have you never\\nheard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\n“I never have.”\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon\\nhis knee. “Here it is,” said he presently:\\n“ ‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the\\nfanciful resemblance to the sound produced\\nby cocking a riﬂe. This terrible secret soci-\\nety was formed by some ex-Confederate sol-\\ndiers in the Southern states after the Civil\\nWar, and it rapidly formed local branches in\\ndifferent parts of the country, notably in Ten-\\nnessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and\\nFlorida. Its power was used for political pur-\\nposes, principally for the terrorising of the\\nnegro voters and the murdering and driving\\nfrom the country of those who were opposed to\\nits views. Its outrages were usually preceded\\nby a warning sent to the marked man in some\\nfantastic but generally recognised shape—a\\nsprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds\\nor orange pips in others. On receiving this\\nthe victim might either openly abjure his for-\\nmer ways, or might ﬂy from the country. If\\nhe braved the matter out, death would unfail-\\ningly come upon him, and usually in some\\nstrange and unforeseen manner. So perfect\\nwas the organisation of the society, and so\\nsystematic its methods, that there is hardly\\na case upon record where any man succeeded\\nin braving it with impunity, or in which any\\nof its outrages were traced home to the per-\\npetrators. For some years the organisation\\nﬂourished in spite of the efforts of the United\\nStates government and of the better classes of\\nthe community in the South. Eventually, in\\nthe year 1869, the movement rather suddenly\\ncollapsed, although there have been sporadic\\noutbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the\\nvolume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society\\nwas coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw\\nfrom America with their papers. It may well have\\nbeen cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and\\nhis family have some of the more implacable spirits\\nupon their track. You can understand that this regis-\\nter and diary may implicate some of the ﬁrst men in\\nthe South, and that there may be many who will not\\nsleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember\\nright, ‘sent the pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the\\nsociety’s warning to them. Then there are successive\\nentries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and\\nﬁnally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result\\nfor C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light\\ninto this dark place, and I believe that the only chance\\nyoung Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I\\nhave told him. There is nothing more to be said or to\\nbe done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let\\nus try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather\\nand the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.”\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was\\nshining with a subdued brightness through the dim\\nveil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes\\nwas already at breakfast when I came down.\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said\\nhe; “I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in\\nlooking into this case of young Openshaw’s.”\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my\\nﬁrst inquiries.

The night, however, was\\nextremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite\\nof the help of several passers-by, it was quite\\nimpossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, how-\\never, was given, and, by the aid of the water-\\npolice, the body was eventually recovered. It\\nproved to be that of a young gentleman whose\\nname, as it appears from an envelope which\\nwas found in his pocket, was John Openshaw,\\nand whose residence is near Horsham. It is\\nconjectured that he may have been hurrying\\ndown to catch the last train from Waterloo\\nStation, and that in his haste and the extreme\\ndarkness he missed his path and walked over\\nthe edge of one of the small landing-places for\\nriver steamboats. The body exhibited no traces\\nof violence, and there can be no doubt that the\\ndeceased had been the victim of an unfortu-\\nnate accident, which should have the effect of\\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the\\ncondition of the riverside landing-stages.”\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more\\ndepressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It\\nis a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It\\nbecomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God\\nsends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.\\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should\\nsend him away to his death—!” He sprang from his\\nchair and paced about the room in uncontrollable\\nagitation, with a ﬂush upon his sallow cheeks and\\na nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin\\nhands.\\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at\\nlast. “How could they have decoyed him down there?\\nThe Embankment is not on the direct line to the sta-\\ntion. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even\\non such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we\\nshall see who will win in the long run. I am going\\nout now!”\\n“To the police?”\\n“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun\\nthe web they may take the ﬂies, but not before.”\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work,\\nand it was late in the evening before I returned to\\nBaker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back\\nyet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, look-\\ning pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,\\nand tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it vo-\\nraciously, washing it down with a long draught of\\nwater.\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\n“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had\\nnothing since breakfast.”\\n“Nothing?”\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\n“Well.”\\n“You have a clue?”\\n“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young\\nOpenshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why,\\nWatson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon\\nthem. It is well thought of!”\\n“What do you mean?”\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing\\nit to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table.\\nOf these he took ﬁve and thrust them into an envelope.\\nOn the inside of the ﬂap he wrote “S.

He\\nwill ﬁnd it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw\\ndid before him.”\\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others,\\nbut he ﬁrst.”\\n“How did you trace it, then?”\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all\\ncovered with dates and names.\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over\\nLloyd’s registers and ﬁles of the old papers, following\\nthe future career of every vessel which touched at\\nPondicherry in January and February in ’ 83.

It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a\\npitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter.\\n“I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\n“Of what day?”\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is\\nWednesday. What d’you want to frighten a chap for?”\\nHe sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a\\nhigh treble key.\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has\\nbeen waiting this two days for you. You should be\\nashamed of yourself!”\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I\\nhave only been here a few hours, three pipes, four\\npipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with you.\\nI wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me\\nyour hand! Have you a cab?”\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something.\\nFind what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do\\nnothing for myself.”\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the\\ndouble row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep\\nout the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and look-\\ning about for the manager. As I passed the tall man\\nwho sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my\\nskirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and\\nthen look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly\\nupon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have\\ncome from the old man at my side, and yet he sat\\nnow as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled,\\nbent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from\\nbetween his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer\\nlassitude from his ﬁngers. I took two steps forward\\nand looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent\\nme from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He\\nhad turned his back so that none could see him but I.\\nHis form had ﬁlled out, his wrinkles were gone, the\\ndull eyes had regained their ﬁre, and there, sitting by\\nthe ﬁre and grinning at my surprise, was none other\\nthan Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to\\nme to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his\\nface half round to the company once more, subsided\\ninto a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you\\ndoing in this den?”\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have ex-\\ncellent ears. If you would have the great kindness\\nto get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be\\nexceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\\n“I have a cab outside.”\\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely\\ntrust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into\\nany mischief. I should recommend you also to send a\\nnote by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\\nthrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside,\\nI shall be with you in ﬁve minutes.”\\nIt was difﬁcult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’\\nrequests, for they were always so exceedingly deﬁnite,\\nand put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I\\nfelt, however, that when Whitney was once conﬁned\\nin the cab my mission was practically accomplished;\\nand for the rest, I could not wish anything better than\\nto be associated with my friend in one of those sin-\\ngular adventures which were the normal condition\\nof his existence. In a few minutes I had written my\\nnote, paid Whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and\\nseen him driven through the darkness. In a very short\\ntime a decrepit ﬁgure had emerged from the opium\\nden, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock\\nHolmes. For two streets he shufﬂed along with a bent\\nback and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly\\nround, he straightened himself out and burst into a\\nhearty ﬁt of laughter.\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine\\nthat I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injec-\\ntions, and all the other little weaknesses on which you\\nhave favoured me with your medical views.”\\n“I was certainly surprised to ﬁnd you there.”\\n“But not more so than I to ﬁnd you.”\\n“I came to ﬁnd a friend.”\\n“And I to ﬁnd an enemy.”\\n70'),\n",

Had I been recognised\\nin that den my life would not have been worth an\\nhour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my\\nown purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it\\nhas sworn to have vengeance upon me.

You do not mean bodies?”\\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we\\nhad £1000 for every poor devil who has been done to\\ndeath in that den.

Be-\\nyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar,\\nits silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall\\nof the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\\nbelated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drift-\\ning slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled\\ndimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.\\nHolmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought,\\nwhile I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new\\nquest might be which seemed to tax his powers so\\nsorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\\nhis thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were\\nbeginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban\\nvillas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoul-\\nders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\\nhas satisﬁed himself that he is acting for the best.\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he.\\n“It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon\\nmy word, it is a great thing for me to have someone\\nto talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant.\\nI was wondering what I should say to this dear little\\nwoman to-night when she meets me at the door.”\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the\\ncase before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly sim-\\nple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon.\\nThere’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the\\nend of it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly\\nand concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see\\na spark where all is dark to me.”\\n“Proceed, then.”\\n“Some years ago—to be deﬁnite, in May,\\n1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair\\nby name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He\\ntook a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely,\\nand lived generally in good style. By degrees he\\nmade friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he\\nmarried the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he\\nnow has two children. He had no occupation, but\\nwas interested in several companies and went into\\ntown as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5.14\\nfrom Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now\\nthirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits,\\na good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man\\nwho is popular with all who know him. I may add\\nthat his whole debts at the present moment, as far as\\nwe have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10s.,\\nwhile he has £220 standing to his credit in the Capital\\nand Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to\\nthink that money troubles have been weighing upon\\nhis mind.\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town\\nrather earlier than usual, remarking before he started\\n71'),\n",

Now, by the merest chance, his wife received\\na telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly af-\\nter his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of\\nconsiderable value which she had been expecting was\\nwaiting for her at the ofﬁces of the Aberdeen Shipping\\nCompany. Now, if you are well up in your London,\\nyou will know that the ofﬁce of the company is in\\nFresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had\\nher lunch, started for the City, did some shopping,\\nproceeded to the company’s ofﬁce, got her packet,\\nand found herself at exactly 4.35 walking through\\nSwandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have\\nyou followed me so far?”\\n“It is very clear.”\\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly\\nhot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing\\nabout in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not\\nlike the neighbourhood in which she found herself.\\nWhile she was walking in this way down Swandam\\nLane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and\\nwas struck cold to see her husband looking down at\\nher and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a\\nsecond-ﬂoor window. The window was open, and she\\ndistinctly saw his face, which she describes as being\\nterribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to\\nher, and then vanished from the window so suddenly\\nthat it seemed to her that he had been plucked back\\nby some irresistible force from behind. One singu-\\nlar point which struck her quick feminine eye was\\nthat although he wore some dark coat, such as he\\nhad started to town in, he had on neither collar nor\\nnecktie.\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him,\\nshe rushed down the steps—for the house was none\\nother than the opium den in which you found me\\nto-night—and running through the front room she\\nattempted to ascend the stairs which led to the ﬁrst\\nﬂoor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this\\nLascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust\\nher back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant\\nthere, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the\\nmost maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down\\nthe lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno\\nStreet a number of constables with an inspector, all\\non their way to their beat. The inspector and two men\\naccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued\\nresistance of the proprietor, they made their way to\\nthe room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen.\\nThere was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole\\nof that ﬂoor there was no one to be found save a crip-\\npled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made\\nhis home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore\\nthat no one else had been in the front room during\\nthe afternoon. So determined was their denial that\\nthe inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\\nbelieve that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when,\\nwith a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay\\nupon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell\\na cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he\\nhad promised to bring home.\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which\\nthe cripple showed, made the inspector realise that\\nthe matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable\\ncrime. The front room was plainly furnished as a\\nsitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which\\nlooked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Be-\\ntween the wharf and the bedroom window is a nar-\\nrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at\\nhigh tide with at least four and a half feet of water.\\nThe bedroom window was a broad one and opened\\nfrom below. On examination traces of blood were to\\nbe seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered\\ndrops were visible upon the wooden ﬂoor of the bed-\\nroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room\\nwere all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the\\nexception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat,\\nand his watch—all were there. There were no signs of\\nviolence upon any of these garments, and there were\\nno other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the\\nwindow he must apparently have gone for no other\\nexit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains\\nupon the sill gave little promise that he could save\\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very\\nhighest at the moment of the tragedy.\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be\\nimmediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was\\nknown to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as,\\nby Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been\\nat the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of\\nher husband’s appearance at the window, he could\\nhardly have been more than an accessory to the crime.\\nHis defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he\\nprotested that he had no knowledge as to the doings\\nof Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not\\naccount in any way for the presence of the missing\\ngentleman’s clothes.\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the\\nsinister cripple who lives upon the second ﬂoor of the\\nopium den, and who was certainly the last human\\nbeing whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His\\n72'),\n",

He is a professional beggar, though in or-\\nder to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a\\nsmall trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down\\nThreadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there\\nis, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the\\nwall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap,\\nand as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity\\ndescends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon\\nthe pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow\\nmore than once before ever I thought of making his\\nprofessional acquaintance, and I have been surprised\\nat the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.\\nHis appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no\\none can pass him without observing him. A shock of\\norange hair, a pale face disﬁgured by a horrible scar,\\nwhich, by its contraction, has turned up the outer\\nedge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of\\nvery penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular\\ncontrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out\\nfrom amid the common crowd of mendicants and so,\\ntoo, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to\\nany piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the\\npassers-by.

Surely your medical\\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness\\nin one limb is often compensated for by exceptional\\nstrength in the others.”\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood\\nupon the window, and she was escorted home in a\\ncab by the police, as her presence could be of no help\\nto them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who\\nhad charge of the case, made a very careful exami-\\nnation of the premises, but without ﬁnding anything\\nwhich threw any light upon the matter. One mistake\\nhad been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he\\nmight have communicated with his friend the Las-\\ncar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was\\nseized and searched, without anything being found\\nwhich could incriminate him. There were, it is true,\\nsome blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he\\npointed to his ring-ﬁnger, which had been cut near\\nthe nail, and explained that the bleeding came from\\nthere, adding that he had been to the window not\\nlong before, and that the stains which had been ob-\\nserved there came doubtless from the same source.\\nHe denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville\\nSt. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes\\nin his room was as much a mystery to him as to the\\npolice. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she had\\nactually seen her husband at the window, he declared\\nthat she must have been either mad or dreaming. He\\nwas removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station,\\nwhile the inspector remained upon the premises in\\nthe hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\\nclue.\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the\\nmud-bank what they had feared to ﬁnd. It was\\nNeville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair,\\nwhich lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what\\ndo you think they found in the pockets?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket\\nstuffed with pennies and half-pennies— 421 pennies\\nand 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had\\nnot been swept away by the tide. But a human body\\nis a different matter. There is a ﬁerce eddy between\\nthe wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that\\nthe weighted coat had remained when the stripped\\nbody had been sucked away into the river.”\\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were\\nfound in the room. Would the body be dressed in a\\ncoat alone?”\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously\\nenough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust\\nNeville St. Clair through the window, there is no\\nhuman eye which could have seen the deed. What\\nwould he do then? It would of course instantly strike\\nhim that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.\\nHe would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that\\nit would swim and not sink. He has little time, for\\nhe has heard the scufﬂe downstairs when the wife\\ntried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already\\nheard from his Lascar confederate that the police are\\nhurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be\\nlost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has\\naccumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs\\nall the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\\npockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws\\nit out, and would have done the same with the other\\ngarments had not he heard the rush of steps below,\\n73'),\n",

Just as\\nhe ﬁnished, however, we drove through two scattered\\nvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the\\nwindows.\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my compan-\\nion. “We have touched on three English counties in\\nour short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over\\nan angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.

Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two\\nrooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that\\nshe will have nothing but a welcome for my friend\\nand colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I\\nhave no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa,\\nthere, whoa!”\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which\\nstood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run\\nout to the horse’s head, and springing down, I fol-\\nlowed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive\\nwhich led to the house. As we approached, the door\\nﬂew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the\\nopening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie,\\nwith a touch of ﬂuffy pink chiffon at her neck and\\nwrists. She stood with her ﬁgure outlined against the\\nﬂood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised\\nin her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and\\nface protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\nstanding question.\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that\\nthere were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which\\nsank into a groan as she saw that my companion\\nshook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n“No good news?”\\n“None.”\\n“No bad?”\\n“No.”\\n“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be\\nweary, for you have had a long day.”\\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of\\nmost vital use to me in several of my cases, and a\\nlucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him\\nout and associate him with this investigation.”\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my\\nhand warmly. “You will, I am sure, forgive anything\\nthat may be wanting in our arrangements, when you\\nconsider the blow which has come so suddenly upon\\nus.”\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old cam-\\npaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that\\nno apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance,\\neither to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\nhappy.”\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as\\nwe entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of\\nwhich a cold supper had been laid out, “I should very\\nmuch like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.”\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hys-\\nterical, nor given to fainting.

It is, of course, a triﬂe, but there\\nis nothing so important as triﬂes. Let us now see the\\nletter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s\\nhand?”\\n“One of his hands.”\\n“One?”\\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very\\nunlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.”\\n“Dearest do not be frightened. All will\\ncome well. There is a huge error which it\\nmay take some little time to rectify. Wait\\nin patience.\\n— “N eville.\\nWritten in pencil upon the ﬂy-leaf of a book, oc-\\ntavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in\\nGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the\\nﬂap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error,\\nby a person who had been chewing tobacco. And\\nyou have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand,\\nmadam?”\\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well,\\nMrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not\\nventure to say that the danger is over.”\\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the\\nwrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It\\nmay have been taken from him.”\\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on\\nMonday and only posted to-day.”\\n“That is possible.”\\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes.\\nI know that all is well with him. There is so keen a\\nsympathy between us that I should know if evil came\\nupon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut\\nhimself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room\\nrushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty\\nthat something had happened. Do you think that I\\nwould respond to such a triﬂe and yet be ignorant of\\nhis death?”\\n“I have seen too much not to know that the im-\\npression of a woman may be more valuable than the\\nconclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter\\nyou certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\\ncorroborate your view. But if your husband is alive\\nand able to write letters, why should he remain away\\nfrom you?”\\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leav-\\ning you?”\\n“No.”\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam\\nLane?”\\n“Very much so.”\\n“Was the window open?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\n“He might.”\\n75'),\n",

Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,\\nwho, when he had an unsolved problem upon his\\nmind, would go for days, and even for a week, with-\\nout rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking\\nat it from every point of view until he had either\\nfathomed it or convinced himself that his data were\\ninsufﬁcient. It was soon evident to me that he was\\nnow preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off\\nhis coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-\\ngown, and then wandered about the room collecting\\npillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and\\narmchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern\\ndivan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged,\\nwith an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches\\nlaid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I\\nsaw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his\\nlips, his eyes ﬁxed vacantly upon the corner of the\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent,\\nmotionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set\\naquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep,\\nand so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into\\nthe apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the\\nsmoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a\\ndense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\n“Yes.”\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know\\nwhere the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have\\nthe trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his\\neyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\\nsombre thinker of the previous night.\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no\\nwonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-ﬁve\\nminutes past four. I had hardly ﬁnished when Holmes\\nreturned with the news that the boy was putting in\\nthe horse.\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he,\\npulling on his boots. “I think, Watson, that you are\\nnow standing in the presence of one of the most ab-\\nsolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\\nhere to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of\\nthe affair now.”\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I\\nam not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of in-\\ncredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it\\nout, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not ﬁt the\\nlock.”\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as pos-\\nsible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In\\nthe road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in,\\nand away we dashed down the London Road. A few\\ncountry carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to\\nthe metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side\\nwere as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said\\nHolmes, ﬂicking the horse on into a gallop. “I confess\\nthat I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to\\nlearn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to\\nlook sleepily from their windows as we drove through\\n76'),\n",

Passing down the Wa-\\nterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the\\nright and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock\\nHolmes was well known to the force, and the two\\nconstables at the door saluted him. One of them held\\nthe horse’s head while the other led us in.\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout ofﬁ-\\ncial had come down the stone-ﬂagged passage, in a\\npeaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a quiet\\nword with you, Bradstreet.” “Certainly, Mr. Holmes.\\nStep into my room here.” It was a small, ofﬁce-like\\nroom, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a tele-\\nphone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat\\ndown at his desk.\\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one\\nwho was charged with being concerned in the disap-\\npearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for fur-\\nther inquiries.”\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\n“In the cells.”\\n“Is he quiet?”\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty\\nscoundrel.”\\n“Dirty?”\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his\\nhands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s. Well,\\nwhen once his case has been settled, he will have a\\nregular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you\\nwould agree with me that he needed it.”\\n“I should like to see him very much.”\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way.\\nYou can leave your bag.”\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He\\nled us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed\\ndown a winding stair, and brought us to a white-\\nwashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector.\\n“Here it is!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper\\npart of the door and glanced through.\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very\\nwell.”\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The pris-\\noner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep\\nsleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-\\nsized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with\\na coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his\\ntattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, ex-\\ntremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face\\ncould not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad\\nwheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to\\nchin, and by its contraction had turned up one side\\nof the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a\\nperpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew\\nlow over his eyes and forehead.\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes.\\n“I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of\\nbringing the tools with me.” He opened the Gladstone\\nbag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a\\nvery large bath-sponge.\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the\\ninspector.\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open\\nthat door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a\\nmuch more respectable ﬁgure.”\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector.\\n“He doesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does\\nhe?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we all\\nvery quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned,\\nand then settled down once more into a deep slum-\\nber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his\\nsponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across\\nand down the prisoner’s face.\\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr.\\nNeville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The\\nman’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark\\nfrom a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone,\\ntoo, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across,\\nand the twisted lip which had given the repulsive\\nsneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tan-\\ngled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was\\na pale, sad-faced, reﬁned-looking man, black-haired\\nand smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring\\nabout him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly\\nrealising the exposure, he broke into a scream and\\nthrew himself down with his face to the pillow.\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed,\\nthe missing man. I know him from the photograph.”\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man\\nwho abandons himself to his destiny. “Be it so,” said\\nhe. “And pray what am I charged with?”\\n77'),\n",

I travelled in my\\nyouth, took to the stage, and ﬁnally became a reporter\\non an evening paper in London. One day my edi-\\ntor wished to have a series of articles upon begging\\nin the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.\\nThere was the point from which all my adventures\\nstarted. It was only by trying begging as an amateur\\nthat I could get the facts upon which to base my arti-\\ncles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the\\nsecrets of making up, and had been famous in the\\ngreen-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\\nattainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as\\npitiable as possible I made a good scar and ﬁxed one\\nside of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of\\nﬂesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair,\\nand an appropriate dress, I took my station in the\\nbusiness part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller\\nbut really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my\\ntrade, and when I returned home in the evening I\\nfound to my surprise that I had received no less than\\n26s. 4d.\\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of\\nthe matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a\\nfriend and had a writ served upon me for £25. I was\\nat my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden\\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from\\nthe creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,\\nand spent the time in begging in the City under my\\ndisguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid\\nthe debt.\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle\\ndown to arduous work at £2 a week when I knew that\\nI could earn as much in a day by smearing my face\\nwith a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\\nsitting still. It was a long ﬁght between my pride and\\nthe money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up\\nreporting and sat day after day in the corner which\\nI had ﬁrst chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face\\nand ﬁlling my pockets with coppers. Only one man\\nknew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den\\nin which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I\\ncould every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and\\nin the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed\\nman about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid\\nby me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret\\nwas safe in his possession.\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving con-\\nsiderable sums of money. I do not mean that any\\nbeggar in the streets of London could earn £700 a\\nyear—which is less than my average takings—but I\\nhad exceptional advantages in my power of making\\nup, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved\\nby practice and made me quite a recognised character\\nin the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by\\nsilver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day\\nin which I failed to take £2.\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a\\nhouse in the country, and eventually married, without\\nanyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation.\\nMy dear wife knew that I had business in the City.\\nShe little knew what.\\n“Last Monday I had ﬁnished for the day and was\\ndressing in my room above the opium den when I\\nlooked out of my window and saw, to my horror and\\nastonishment, that my wife was standing in the street,\\nwith her eyes ﬁxed full upon me.

He was\\nlounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,\\na pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a\\npile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly\\nstudied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden\\nchair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy\\nand disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for\\nwear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a\\nforceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested\\nthat the hat had been suspended in this manner for\\nthe purpose of examination.\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt\\nyou.”\\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom\\nI can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly\\ntrivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of\\nthe old hat—“but there are points in connection with\\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even\\nof instruction.”\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my\\nhands before his crackling ﬁre, for a sharp frost had\\nset in, and the windows were thick with the ice crys-\\ntals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it\\nlooks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to\\nit—that it is the clue which will guide you in the so-\\nlution of some mystery and the punishment of some\\ncrime.”\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laugh-\\ning. “Only one of those whimsical little incidents\\nwhich will happen when you have four million hu-\\nman beings all jostling each other within the space of\\na few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of\\nso dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combi-\\nnation of events may be expected to take place, and\\nmany a little problem will be presented which may\\nbe striking and bizarre without being criminal. We\\nhave already had experience of such.”\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six\\ncases which I have added to my notes, three have\\nbeen entirely free of any legal crime.”\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover\\nthe Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss\\nMary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man\\nwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this\\nsmall matter will fall into the same innocent category.\\nYou know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\n“It is his hat.”\\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg\\nthat you will look upon it not as a battered billycock\\nbut as an intellectual problem. And, ﬁrst, as to how\\nit came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in\\ncompany with a good fat goose, which is, I have no\\ndoubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s\\nﬁre. The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christ-\\nmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very\\nhonest fellow, was returning from some small jolli-\\nﬁcation and was making his way homeward down\\nTottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the\\ngaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,\\nand carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.\\nAs he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row\\nbroke out between this stranger and a little knot of\\nroughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat,\\non which he raised his stick to defend himself and,\\nswinging it over his head, smashed the shop win-\\ndow behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to\\nprotect the stranger from his assailants; but the man,\\nshocked at having broken the window, and seeing an\\nofﬁcial-looking person in uniform rushing towards\\nhim, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and van-\\nished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at\\nthe back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had\\nalso ﬂed at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was\\nleft in possession of the ﬁeld of battle, and also of the\\nspoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and\\na most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true\\nthat ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small\\ncard which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also\\ntrue that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining\\nof this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of\\nours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one\\nof them.”\\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on\\nChristmas morning, knowing that even the smallest\\nproblems are of interest to me. The goose we retained\\nuntil this morning, when there were signs that, in\\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should\\nbe eaten without unnecessary delay. Its ﬁnder has\\ncarried it off, therefore, to fulﬁl the ultimate destiny\\nof a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the\\nunknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\n“No.”\\n83'),\n",

What can you gather from\\nthis old battered felt?”\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What\\ncan you gather yourself as to the individuality of the\\nman who has worn this article?”\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned\\nit over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black\\nhat of the usual round shape, hard and much the\\nworse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\\nwas a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s\\nname; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials “H.\\nB.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in\\nthe brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was miss-\\ning. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty,\\nand spotted in several places, although there seemed\\nto have been some attempt to hide the discoloured\\npatches by smearing them with ink.\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my\\nfriend.\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.\\nYou fail, however, to reason from what you see. You\\nare too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer\\nfrom this hat?”\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar\\nintrospective fashion which was characteristic of him.\\n“It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,”\\nhe remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences\\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which rep-\\nresent at least a strong balance of probability. That\\nthe man was highly intellectual is of course obvious\\nupon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-\\ndo within the last three years, although he has now\\nfallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less\\nnow than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression,\\nwhich, when taken with the decline of his fortunes,\\nseems to indicate some evil inﬂuence, probably drink,\\nat work upon him. This may account also for the\\nobvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-\\nrespect,” he continued, disregarding my remon-\\nstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life,\\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-\\naged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within\\nthe last few days, and which he anoints with lime-\\ncream. These are the more patent facts which are to\\nbe deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is\\nextremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his\\nhouse.”\\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now,\\nwhen I give you these results, you are unable to see\\nhow they are attained?”\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must\\nconfess that I am unable to follow you. For example,\\nhow did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head.\\nIt came right over the forehead and settled upon the\\nbridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic capac-\\nity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have\\nsomething in it.”\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\n“This hat is three years old. These ﬂat brims curled\\nat the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best\\nquality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the ex-\\ncellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so\\nexpensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat\\nsince, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how\\nabout the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,”\\nsaid he putting his ﬁnger upon the little disc and loop\\nof the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon hats. If\\nthis man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount\\nof foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he\\nhas broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace\\nit, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than\\nformerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening\\nnature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to\\nconceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing\\nthem with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely\\nlost his self-respect.”\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that\\nhis hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and\\nthat he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a\\nclose examination of the lower part of the lining. The\\nlens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut\\nby the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be\\nadhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.\\nThis dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust\\nof the street but the ﬂuffy brown dust of the house,\\nshowing that it has been hung up indoors most of the\\ntime, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are\\n84'),\n",

I\\nsuppose you know what you have got?”\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into\\nglass as though it were putty.”\\n“It’s more than a precious stone. It is the precious\\nstone.”\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I\\nejaculated.\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape,\\nseeing that I have read the advertisement about it in\\nThe Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique,\\nand its value can only be conjectured, but the reward\\noffered of £1000 is certainly not within a twentieth\\npart of the market price.”\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!”\\nThe commissionaire plumped down into a chair and\\nstared from one to the other of us.\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know\\nthat there are sentimental considerations in the back-\\nground which would induce the Countess to part with\\nhalf her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel\\nCosmopolitan,” I remarked.\\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just ﬁve days\\nago.

You\\nsee, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly as-\\nsumed a much more important and less innocent\\naspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the\\ngoose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the\\ngentleman with the bad hat and all the other char-\\nacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we\\nmust set ourselves very seriously to ﬁnding this gen-\\ntleman and ascertaining what part he has played in\\nthis little mystery. To do this, we must try the sim-\\nplest means ﬁrst, and these lie undoubtedly in an\\nadvertisement in all the evening papers.

Now,\\nthen: ‘Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose\\nand a black felt hat.

But will he see it?”\\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers,\\nsince, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He\\nwas clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking\\nthe window and by the approach of Peterson that he\\nthought of nothing but ﬂight, but since then he must\\nhave bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him\\nto drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of\\nhis name will cause him to see it, for everyone who\\nknows him will direct his attention to it. Here you\\nare, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and\\nhave this put in the evening papers.”\\n“In which, sir?”\\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James’s,\\nEvening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that oc-\\ncur to you.”\\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And,\\nI say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back\\nand leave it here with me, for we must have one to\\ngive to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\nfamily is now devouring.”\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took\\nup the stone and held it against the light. “It’s a\\nbonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and\\nsparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\\nEvery good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits.\\nIn the larger and older jewels every facet may stand\\nfor a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years\\nold. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River\\nin southern China and is remarkable in having every\\ncharacteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in\\nshade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it\\nhas already a sinister history. There have been two\\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several rob-\\nberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain\\nweight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that\\nso pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\\nand the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now\\nand drop a line to the Countess to say that we have\\nit.”\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\\n“I cannot tell.”\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one,\\nHenry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?”\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker\\nis an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that\\nthe bird which he was carrying was of considerably\\nmore value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test if we\\nhave an answer to our advertisement.”\\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“In that case I shall continue my professional\\nround. But I shall come back in the evening at the\\nhour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the\\nsolution of so tangled a business.”\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven.

Just\\nas I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown\\nup together to Holmes’ room.\\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from\\nhis armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy\\nair of geniality which he could so readily assume.\\n“Pray take this chair by the ﬁre, Mr. Baker. It is a\\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more\\nadapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you\\nhave just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr.\\nBaker?”\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a\\nmassive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping\\ndown to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch\\nof red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of\\nhis extended hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to\\nhis habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned\\nright up in front, with the collar turned up, and his\\nlank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign\\nof cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion,\\nchoosing his words with care, and gave the impres-\\nsion generally of a man of learning and letters who\\nhad had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\n“We have retained these things for some days,”\\nsaid Holmes, “because we expected to see an adver-\\ntisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss\\nto know now why you did not advertise.”\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh.\\n“Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they\\nonce were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the\\ngang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both\\nmy hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more\\nmoney in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”\\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we\\nwere compelled to eat it.”\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in\\nhis excitement.\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had\\nwe not done so. But I presume that this other goose\\nupon the sideboard, which is about the same weight\\nand perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally\\nwell?”\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with\\na sigh of relief.\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop,\\nand so on of your own bird, so if you wish—”\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might\\nbe useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he,\\n“but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta\\nmembra of my late acquaintance are going to be to\\nme. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will\\nconﬁne my attentions to the excellent bird which I\\nperceive upon the sideboard.”\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me\\nwith a slight shrug of his shoulders.\\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said\\nhe. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where\\nyou got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl\\nfancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and\\ntucked his newly gained property under his arm.\\n“There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn,\\nnear the Museum—we are to be found in the Mu-\\nseum itself during the day, you understand. This\\nyear our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a\\ngoose club, by which, on consideration of some few\\npence every week, we were each to receive a bird at\\nChristmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest\\nis familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir,\\nfor a Scotch bonnet is ﬁtted neither to my years nor\\nmy gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he\\nbowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his\\nway.\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes\\nwhen he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite\\ncertain that he knows nothing whatever about the\\nmatter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\n“Not particularly.”\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a\\nsupper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.”\\n“By all means.”\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and\\nwrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars\\nwere shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath\\nof the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many\\npistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly\\nas we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole\\nStreet, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street\\ninto Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were\\nin Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small\\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which\\nruns down into Holborn.

A few yards\\noff he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the\\nhearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut\\nand the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you\\ncan always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay\\nthat if I had put £100 down in front of him, that man\\nwould not have given me such complete information\\nas was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing\\nme on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing\\nthe end of our quest, and the only point which re-\\nmains to be determined is whether we should go on to\\nthis Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should re-\\nserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly\\nfellow said that there are others besides ourselves\\nwho are anxious about the matter, and I should—”\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud\\nhubbub which broke out from the stall which we had\\njust left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fel-\\nlow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breck-\\ninridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall,\\nwas shaking his ﬁsts ﬁercely at the cringing ﬁgure.\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he\\nshouted. “I wish you were all at the devil together. If\\nyou come pestering me any more with your silly talk\\nI’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here\\nand I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it?\\nDid I buy the geese off you?”\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,”\\nwhined the little man.\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all\\nI care. I’ve had enough of it. Get out of this!” He\\nrushed ﬁercely forward, and the inquirer ﬂitted away\\ninto the darkness.\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,”\\nwhispered Holmes. “Come with me, and we will see\\nwhat is to be made of this fellow.” Striding through\\nthe scattered knots of people who lounged round the\\nﬂaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the\\nlittle man and touched him upon the shoulder. He\\nsprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that\\nevery vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he\\nasked in a quavering voice.\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I\\ncould not help overhearing the questions which you\\nput to the salesman just now. I think that I could be\\nof assistance to you.”\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know any-\\nthing of the matter?”\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business\\nto know what other people don’t know.”\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are en-\\ndeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by\\nMrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named\\nBreckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the\\nAlpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry\\nBaker is a member.”\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed\\nto meet,” cried the little fellow with outstretched\\nhands and quivering ﬁngers. “I can hardly explain to\\nyou how interested I am in this matter.”\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was\\npassing. “In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy\\nroom rather than in this wind-swept market-place,”\\nsaid he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who\\nit is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is\\nJohn Robinson,” he answered with a sidelong glance.\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It\\nis always awkward doing business with an alias.”\\nA ﬂush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger.\\n“Well then,” said he, “my real name is James Ryder.”\\n“Precisely so.

You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the\\nbasket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then!

Holmes unlocked\\nhis strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which\\nshone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-\\npointed radiance.

Give him an\\narm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not got blood\\nenough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him\\na dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more\\nhuman.

Still, that little may as well\\nbe cleared up to make the case complete. You had\\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of\\nMorcar’s?”\\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said\\nhe in a crackling voice.\\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the\\ntemptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was\\ntoo much for you, as it has been for better men be-\\nfore you; but you were not very scrupulous in the\\nmeans you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there\\nis the making of a very pretty villain in you.

I will leave the country, sir.\\nThen the charge against him will break down.”\\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us\\nhear a true account of the next act.

Tell us the truth, for there lies your\\nonly hope of safety.”\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips.\\n“I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he.\\n“When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me\\nthat it would be best for me to get away with the\\nstone at once, for I did not know at what moment the\\npolice might not take it into their heads to search me\\nand my room. There was no place about the hotel\\nwhere it would be safe. I went out, as if on some com-\\nmission, and I made for my sister’s house.

One day he had met me, and fell into talk\\nabout the ways of thieves, and how they could get\\nrid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true\\nto me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I\\nmade up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\\nhe lived, and take him into my conﬁdence. He would\\nshow me how to turn the stone into money. But how\\nto get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at\\nany moment be seized and searched, and there would\\nbe the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning\\nagainst the wall at the time and looking at the geese\\nwhich were waddling about round my feet, and sud-\\ndenly an idea came into my head which showed me\\nhow I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that\\nI might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas\\npresent, and I knew that she was always as good as\\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I\\nwould carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little\\nshed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the\\nbirds—a ﬁne big one, white, with a barred tail. I\\ncaught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone\\ndown its throat as far as my ﬁnger could reach. The\\nbird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gul-\\nlet and down into its crop. But the creature ﬂapped\\nand struggled, and out came my sister to know what\\nwas the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute\\nbroke loose and ﬂuttered off among the others.\\n“ ‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’\\nsays she.\\n“ ‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for\\nChristmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\\n“ ‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for\\nyou—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one\\nover yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes\\none for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the\\nmarket.’\\n“ ‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the\\nsame to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling\\njust now.’\\n“ ‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said\\nshe, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\\n“ ‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it\\nnow,’ said I.\\n“ ‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed.\\n‘Which is it you want, then?’\\n“ ‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the\\nmiddle of the ﬂock.’\\n“ ‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I car-\\nried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal\\nwhat I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to\\ntell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked,\\nand we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart\\nturned to water, for there was no sign of the stone,\\nand I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred.\\nI left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried\\ninto the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen\\nthere.\\n“ ‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\n“ ‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\n“ ‘Which dealer’s?’\\n“ ‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\\n“ ‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I\\nasked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’\\n“ ‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and\\nI could never tell them apart.’\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as\\nhard as my feet would carry me to this man Breck-\\ninridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one\\nword would he tell me as to where they had gone.\\nYou heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has al-\\nways answered me like that. My sister thinks that\\nI am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am my-\\nself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief,\\nwithout ever having touched the wealth for which I\\nsold my character. God help me! God help me!” He\\nburst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\\nhis hands.\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy\\nbreathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock\\nHolmes’ ﬁnger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then\\nmy friend rose and threw open the door.\\n“Get out!” said he.\\n“What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!”\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a\\nrush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and\\nthe crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his\\nhand for his clay pipe, “I am not retained by the po-\\nlice to supply their deﬁciencies. If Horner were in\\ndanger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I\\nsuppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just\\npossible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not\\ngo wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send\\nhim to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life.\\n91'),\n",

Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot\\nrecall any which presented more singular features\\nthan that which was associated with the well-known\\nSurrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my as-\\nsociation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms\\nas bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might\\nhave placed them upon record before, but a promise\\nof secrecy was made at the time, from which I have\\nonly been freed during the last month by the untimely\\ndeath of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It\\nis perhaps as well that the facts should now come\\nto light, for I have reasons to know that there are\\nwidespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby\\nRoylott which tend to make the matter even more\\nterrible than the truth.\\nIt was early in April in the year ’ 83 that I woke\\none morning to ﬁnd Sherlock Holmes standing, fully\\ndressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as\\na rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed\\nme that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked\\nup at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little\\nresentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he,\\n“but it’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson\\nhas been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on\\nyou.”\\n“What is it, then—a ﬁre?”\\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has ar-\\nrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists\\nupon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-\\nroom. Now, when young ladies wander about the\\nmetropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock\\nsleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is\\nsomething very pressing which they have to commu-\\nnicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you\\nwould, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I\\nthought, at any rate, that I should call you and give\\nyou the chance.”\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes\\nin his professional investigations, and in admiring\\nthe rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet\\nalways founded on a logical basis with which he un-\\nravelled the problems which were submitted to him.\\nI rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a\\nfew minutes to accompany my friend down to the\\nsitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily\\nveiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as\\nwe entered.\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily.\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate\\nfriend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you\\ncan speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad\\nto see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to\\nlight the ﬁre. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order\\nyou a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are\\nshivering.”\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the\\nwoman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\\n“What, then?”\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her\\nveil as she spoke, and we could see that she was in-\\ndeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn\\nand grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of\\nsome hunted animal. Her features and ﬁgure were\\nthose of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with\\npremature grey, and her expression was weary and\\nhaggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of\\nhis quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending\\nforward and patting her forearm. “We shall soon set\\nmatters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by\\ntrain this morning, I see.”\\n“You know me, then?”\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket\\nin the palm of your left glove. You must have started\\nearly, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart,\\nalong heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewil-\\nderment at my companion.\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he,\\nsmiling. “The left arm of your jacket is spattered with\\nmud in no less than seven places. The marks are per-\\nfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you\\nsit on the left-hand side of the driver.”\\n“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly\\ncorrect,” said she. “I started from home before six,\\nreached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by\\nthe ﬁrst train to Waterloo.

Nothing was left save\\na few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old\\nhouse, which is itself crushed under a heavy mort-\\ngage. The last squire dragged out his existence there,\\nliving the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but\\nhis only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt\\nhimself to the new conditions, obtained an advance\\nfrom a relative, which enabled him to take a medical\\ndegree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his profes-\\nsional skill and his force of character, he established\\na large practice. In a ﬁt of anger, however, caused by\\nsome robberies which had been perpetrated in the\\nhouse, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly\\nescaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a\\nlong term of imprisonment and afterwards returned\\nto England a morose and disappointed man.\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my\\nmother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-\\nGeneral Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years\\nold at the time of my mother’s re-marriage. She had\\na considerable sum of money—not less than £1000 a\\nyear—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a\\ncertain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in\\nthe event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to\\nEngland my mother died—she was killed eight years\\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then\\nabandoned his attempts to establish himself in prac-\\ntice in London and took us to live with him in the old\\nancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which\\nmy mother had left was enough for all our wants, and\\nthere seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather\\nabout this time. Instead of making friends and ex-\\nchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at ﬁrst\\nbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back\\nin the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house\\nand seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious\\nquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence\\nof temper approaching to mania has been hereditary\\nin the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case\\nit had, I believe, been intensiﬁed by his long residence\\nin the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took\\nplace, two of which ended in the police-court, until at\\nlast he became the terror of the village, and the folks\\nwould ﬂy at his approach, for he is a man of immense\\nstrength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a\\nparapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over\\nall the money which I could gather together that I\\nwas able to avert another public exposure. He had\\nno friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he\\nwould give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon\\nthe few acres of bramble-covered land which repre-\\nsent the family estate, and would accept in return the\\n96'),\n",

You can understand that,\\nliving the life which I have described, we were little\\nlikely to see anyone of our own age and position. We\\nhad, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister,\\nMiss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and\\nwe were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this\\nlady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years\\nago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to\\nwhom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of\\nthe engagement when my sister returned and offered\\nno objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight\\nof the day which had been ﬁxed for the wedding, the\\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my\\nonly companion.”\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his\\nchair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a\\ncushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced\\nacross at his visitor.\\n“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that\\ndreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-\\nhouse is, as I have already said, very old, and only one\\nwing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing\\nare on the ground ﬂoor, the sitting-rooms being in the\\ncentral block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the\\nﬁrst is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the\\nthird my own. There is no communication between\\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor.\\nDo I make myself plain?”\\n“Perfectly so.”\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon\\nthe lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his\\nroom early, though we knew that he had not retired\\nto rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of\\nthe strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to\\nsmoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into\\nmine, where she sat for some time, chatting about\\nher approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose\\nto leave me, but she paused at the door and looked\\nback.\\n“ ‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard\\nanyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\\n“ ‘Never,’ said I.\\n“ ‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle,\\nyourself, in your sleep?’\\n“ ‘Certainly not. But why?’\\n“ ‘Because during the last few nights I have always,\\nabout three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle.\\nI am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot\\ntell where it came from—perhaps from the next room,\\nperhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just\\nask you whether you had heard it.’\\n“ ‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies\\nin the plantation.’\\n“ ‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I\\nwonder that you did not hear it also.’\\n“ ‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\\n“ ‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’\\nShe smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few\\nmoments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom al-\\nways to lock yourselves in at night?”\\n“Always.”\\n“And why?”\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor\\nkept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of\\nsecurity unless our doors were locked.”\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of\\nimpending misfortune impressed me. My sister and\\nI, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how\\nsubtle are the links which bind two souls which are\\nso closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was\\nhowling outside, and the rain was beating and splash-\\ning against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream\\nof a terriﬁed woman. I knew that it was my sister’s\\nvoice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round\\nme, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister\\ndescribed, and a few moments later a clanging sound,\\nas if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the\\npassage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved\\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken,\\nnot knowing what was about to issue from it.

I ran to her and threw my\\narms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed\\nto give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as\\none who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dread-\\nfully convulsed. At ﬁrst I thought that she had not\\nrecognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly\\nshrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh,\\nmy God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’\\nThere was something else which she would fain have\\nsaid, and she stabbed with her ﬁnger into the air in\\nthe direction of the doctor’s room, but a fresh con-\\nvulsion seized her and choked her words.

When\\nhe reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and\\nthough he poured brandy down her throat and sent\\nfor medical aid from the village, all efforts were in\\nvain, for she slowly sank and died without having\\nrecovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\\nend of my beloved sister.”\\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about\\nthis whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to\\nit?”\\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at\\nthe inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it,\\nand yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking\\nof an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand\\nwas found the charred stump of a match, and in her\\nleft a match-box.”\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked\\nabout her when the alarm took place. That is impor-\\ntant. And what conclusions did the coroner come\\nto?”\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr.\\nRoylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the\\ncounty, but he was unable to ﬁnd any satisfactory\\ncause of death. My evidence showed that the door\\nhad been fastened upon the inner side, and the win-\\ndows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with\\nbroad iron bars, which were secured every night. The\\nwalls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be\\nquite solid all round, and the ﬂooring was also thor-\\noughly examined, with the same result. The chimney\\nis wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is\\ncertain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any\\nviolence upon her.”\\n“How about poison?”\\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without suc-\\ncess.”\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady\\ndied of, then?”\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and ner-\\nvous shock, though what it was that frightened her I\\ncannot imagine.”\\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion\\nto a band—a speckled band?”\\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the\\nwild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have re-\\nferred to some band of people, perhaps to these very\\ngipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the\\nspotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear\\nover their heads might have suggested the strange\\nadjective which she used.”\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from\\nbeing satisﬁed.\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go\\non with your narrative.”\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life\\nhas been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago,\\nhowever, a dear friend, whom I have known for many\\nyears, has done me the honour to ask my hand in mar-\\nriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the\\nsecond son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near\\nReading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to\\nthe match, and we are to be married in the course of\\nthe spring. Two days ago some repairs were started\\nin the west wing of the building, and my bedroom\\nwall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into\\nthe chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep\\nin the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then,\\nmy thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake,\\nthinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the\\nsilence of the night the low whistle which had been\\nthe herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the\\nlamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was\\ntoo shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed,\\nand as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got\\na dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and\\ndrove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on\\nthis morning with the one object of seeing you and\\nasking your advice.”\\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have\\nyou told me all?”\\n“Yes, all.”\\n98'),\n",

Five little livid spots, the marks of four\\nﬁngers and a thumb, were printed upon the white\\nwrist.\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her\\ninjured wrist. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and\\nperhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes\\nleaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the\\ncrackling ﬁre.\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last.\\n“There are a thousand details which I should desire\\nto know before I decide upon our course of action.\\nYet we have not a moment to lose.

What are you going to\\ndo yourself?”\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to\\ndo now that I am in town.

I\\nhave myself some small business matters to attend to.\\nWill you not wait and breakfast?”\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already\\nsince I have conﬁded my trouble to you. I shall\\nlook forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She\\ndropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\\nfrom the room.\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked\\nSherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister\\nbusiness.”\\n“Dark enough and sinister enough.”\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the ﬂooring\\nand walls are sound, and that the door, window, and\\nchimney are impassable, then her sister must have\\nbeen undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\\nend.”\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles,\\nand what of the very peculiar words of the dying\\nwoman?”\\n“I cannot think.”\\n“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night,\\nthe presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate\\nterms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every\\nreason to believe that the doctor has an interest in\\npreventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying al-\\nlusion to a band, and, ﬁnally, the fact that Miss Helen\\nStoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been\\ncaused by one of those metal bars that secured the\\nshutters falling back into its place, I think that there is\\ngood ground to think that the mystery may be cleared\\nalong those lines.”\\n“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n“I see many objections to any such theory.”\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that\\nwe are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see\\nwhether the objections are fatal, or if they may be\\nexplained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my com-\\npanion by the fact that our door had been suddenly\\ndashed open, and that a huge man had framed him-\\nself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mix-\\nture of the professional and of the agricultural, having\\na black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high\\ngaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So\\ntall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar\\nof the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it\\nacross from side to side. A large face, seared with a\\nthousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and\\nmarked with every evil passion, was turned from one\\nto the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes,\\nand his high, thin, ﬂeshless nose, gave him somewhat\\nthe resemblance to a ﬁerce old bird of prey.\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,”\\nsaid my companion quietly.\\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take\\na seat.”\\n99'),\n",

He held in his hand\\na sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and\\nﬁgures.\\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he.\\n“To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged\\nto work out the present prices of the investments with\\nwhich it is concerned. The total income, which at\\nthe time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100,\\nis now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not\\nmore than £750. Each daughter can claim an income\\nof £250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore,\\nthat if both girls had married, this beauty would have\\nhad a mere pittance, while even one of them would\\ncripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s\\nwork has not been wasted, since it has proved that\\nhe has the very strongest motives for standing in the\\nway of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is\\ntoo serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is\\naware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs;\\nso if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to\\nWaterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would\\nslip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No.2 is\\nan excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist\\nsteel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I\\nthink, all that we need.”\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train\\nfor Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station\\ninn and drove for four or ﬁve miles through the lovely\\nSurrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun\\nand a few ﬂeecy clouds in the heavens. The trees\\nand wayside hedges were just throwing out their ﬁrst\\ngreen shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell\\nof the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange\\ncontrast between the sweet promise of the spring and\\nthis sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My\\ncompanion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded,\\nhis hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk\\nupon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.

It\\nmay stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.\\nYou see that we have been as good as our word.”\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to\\nmeet us with a face which spoke her joy. “I have been\\nwaiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands\\nwith us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr.\\nRoylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he\\nwill be back before evening.”\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s\\nacquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he\\nsketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned\\nwhite to the lips as she listened.\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me,\\nthen.”\\n“So it appears.”\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am\\nsafe from him.

If he\\nis violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time,\\nso kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are\\nto examine.”\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone,\\nwith a high central portion and two curving wings,\\nlike the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In\\none of these wings the windows were broken and\\nblocked with wooden boards, while the roof was\\npartly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central por-\\ntion was in little better repair, but the right-hand\\nblock was comparatively modern, and the blinds in\\nthe windows, with the blue smoke curling up from\\nthe chimneys, showed that this was where the family\\nresided. Some scaffolding had been erected against\\nthe end wall, and the stone-work had been broken\\ninto, but there were no signs of any workmen at the\\nmoment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and\\ndown the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\\nattention the outsides of the windows.\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you\\nused to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and\\nthe one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott’s\\nchamber?”\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle\\none.”\\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the\\nway, there does not seem to be any very pressing need\\nfor repairs at that end wall.”\\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse\\nto move me from my room.”\\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side\\nof this narrow wing runs the corridor from which\\nthese three rooms open. There are windows in it, of\\ncourse?”\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone\\nto pass through.”\\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your\\nrooms were unapproachable from that side. Now,\\nwould you have the kindness to go into your room\\nand bar your shutters?”\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful\\nexamination through the open window, endeavoured\\nin every way to force the shutter open, but without\\nsuccess. There was no slit through which a knife\\ncould be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens\\nhe tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built\\nﬁrmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he,\\nscratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory\\ncertainly presents some difﬁculties.

Holmes\\nrefused to examine the third chamber, so we passed\\nat once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was\\nnow sleeping, and in which her sister had met with\\nher fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceil-\\ning and a gaping ﬁreplace, after the fashion of old\\ncountry-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in an-\\nother, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the\\nwindow. These articles, with two small wicker-work\\nchairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for\\na square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards\\nround and the panelling of the walls were of brown,\\nworm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may\\nhave dated from the original building of the house.\\nHolmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and\\nup and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he\\nasked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung\\n101'),\n",

We used always\\nto get what we wanted for ourselves.”\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a\\nbell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes\\nwhile I satisfy myself as to this ﬂoor.” He threw him-\\nself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and\\ncrawled swiftly backward and forward, examining\\nminutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did\\nthe same with the wood-work with which the cham-\\nber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed\\nand spent some time in staring at it and in running\\nhis eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the\\nbell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very\\ninteresting. You can see now that it is fastened to\\na hook just above where the little opening for the\\nventilator is.”\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the\\nrope. “There are one or two very singular points\\nabout this room. For example, what a fool a builder\\nmust be to open a ventilator into another room, when,\\nwith the same trouble, he might have communicated\\nwith the outside air!”\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” re-\\nmarked Holmes.\\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out\\nabout that time.”\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting\\ncharacter—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which\\ndo not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner,\\nwe shall now carry our researches into the inner apart-\\nment.”\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than\\nthat of his step-daughter, but was as plainly fur-\\nnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of\\nbooks, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall,\\na round table, and a large iron safe were the principal\\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly\\nround and examined each and all of them with the\\nkeenest interest.\\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it\\nwas full of papers.”\\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of\\nmilk which stood on the top of it.\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah\\nand a baboon.”\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat,\\nand yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satis-\\nfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which\\nI should wish to determine.” He squatted down in\\nfront of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it\\nwith the greatest attention.\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising\\nand putting his lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is\\nsomething interesting!”\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small\\ndog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash,\\nhowever, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make\\na loop of whipcord.\\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know\\nwhy it should be tied.”\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a\\nwicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains\\nto crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen\\nenough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission\\nwe shall walk out upon the lawn.”\\nI had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his\\nbrow so dark as it was when we turned from the\\nscene of this investigation. We had walked several\\ntimes up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor\\nmyself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he\\nroused himself from his reverie.\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that\\nyou should absolutely follow my advice in every re-\\nspect.”\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your\\nlife may depend upon your compliance.”\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\n“In the ﬁrst place, both my friend and I must\\nspend the night in your room.”\\n102'),\n",

Your windows would be visible from\\nthere?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“You must conﬁne yourself to your room, on pre-\\ntence of a headache, when your stepfather comes\\nback. Then when you hear him retire for the night,\\nyou must open the shutters of your window, undo\\nthe hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and\\nthen withdraw quietly with everything which you\\nare likely to want into the room which you used to\\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs,\\nyou could manage there for one night.”\\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\\n“But what will you do?”\\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we\\nshall investigate the cause of this noise which has\\ndisturbed you.”\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already\\nmade up your mind,” said Miss Stoner, laying her\\nhand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause\\nof my sister’s death.”\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I\\nspeak.”\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought\\nis correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.”\\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was\\nprobably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss\\nStoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned\\nand saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,\\nand be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,\\nyou may rest assured that we shall soon drive away\\nthe dangers that threaten you.”\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difﬁculty in engag-\\ning a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.\\nThey were on the upper ﬂoor, and from our window\\nwe could command a view of the avenue gate, and\\nof the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.\\nAt dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his\\nhuge form looming up beside the little ﬁgure of the\\nlad who drove him. The boy had some slight difﬁ-\\nculty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard\\nthe hoarse roar of the doctor’s voice and saw the fury\\nwith which he shook his clinched ﬁsts at him. The\\ntrap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sud-\\nden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was\\nlit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat to-\\ngether in the gathering darkness, “I have really some\\nscruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct\\nelement of danger.”\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen\\nmore in these rooms than was visible to me.”\\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little\\nmore. I imagine that you saw all that I did.”\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and\\nwhat purpose that could answer I confess is more\\nthan I can imagine.”\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very un-\\nusual thing to have a small opening between two\\nrooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass\\nthrough.”\\n“I knew that we should ﬁnd a ventilator before\\never we came to Stoke Moran.”\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement\\nshe said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar.\\nNow, of course that suggested at once that there must\\nbe a communication between the two rooms. It could\\nonly be a small one, or it would have been remarked\\nupon at the coroner’s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of\\ndates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady\\nwho sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?”\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about\\nthat bed?”\\n“No.”\\n“It was clamped to the ﬂoor. Did you ever see a\\nbed fastened like that before?”\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always\\nbe in the same relative position to the ventilator and\\nto the rope—or so we may call it, since it was clearly\\nnever meant for a bell-pull.”\\n103'),\n",

He has\\nnerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard\\nwere among the heads of their profession. This man\\nstrikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall\\nbe able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors\\nenough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake\\nlet us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few\\nhours to something more cheerful.”\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was\\nextinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the\\nManor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and\\nthen, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single\\nbright light shone out right in front of us.\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his\\nfeet; “it comes from the middle window.”\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with\\nthe landlord, explaining that we were going on a late\\nvisit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that\\nwe might spend the night there. A moment later we\\nwere out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our\\nfaces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us\\nthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\\nThere was little difﬁculty in entering the grounds,\\nfor unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.\\nMaking our way among the trees, we reached the\\nlawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\\nwindow when out from a clump of laurel bushes there\\ndarted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted\\nchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing\\nlimbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\\ndarkness.\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His\\nhand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.\\nThen he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my\\near.\\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is\\nthe baboon.”\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor\\naffected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might\\nﬁnd it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess\\nthat I felt easier in my mind when, after following\\nHolmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found\\nmyself inside the bedroom. My companion noise-\\nlessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the\\ntable, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as\\nwe had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to\\nme and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered\\ninto my ear again so gently that it was all that I could\\ndo to distinguish the words:\\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n“We must sit without light. He would see it\\nthrough the ventilator.”\\nI nodded again.\\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend\\nupon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should\\nneed it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in\\nthat chair.”\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of\\nthe table.\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this\\nhe placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the\\nbox of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he\\nturned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could\\nnot hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath,\\nand yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed,\\nwithin a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the\\nleast ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-\\nbird, and once at our very window a long drawn\\ncatlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was\\nindeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep\\ntones of the parish clock, which boomed out every\\nquarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three,\\nand still we sat waiting silently for whatever might\\nbefall.\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a\\nlight up in the direction of the ventilator, which van-\\nished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong\\nsmell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in\\nthe next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gen-\\ntle sound of movement, and then all was silent once\\nmore, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\\nhour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly an-\\nother sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing\\nsound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping con-\\ntinually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and\\nlashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\nBut I saw nothing.

I could, however, see that\\nhis face was deadly pale and ﬁlled with horror and\\nloathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up\\nat the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the\\nsilence of the night the most horrible cry to which I\\nhave ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder,\\na hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled\\nin the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down\\nin the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that\\ncry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he\\nat me, until the last echoes of it had died away into\\nthe silence from which it rose.\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered.\\n“And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your\\npistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way\\ndown the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber\\ndoor without any reply from within. Then he turned\\nthe handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\\npistol in my hand.\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On\\nthe table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half\\nopen, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron\\nsafe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on\\nthe wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a\\nlong grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding\\nbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turk-\\nish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with\\nthe long lash which we had noticed during the day.\\nHis chin was cocked upward and his eyes were ﬁxed\\nin a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.\\nRound his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with\\nbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\\nround his head. As we entered he made neither sound\\nnor motion.\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered\\nHolmes.\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange\\nheadgear began to move, and there reared itself from\\namong his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the dead-\\nliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds\\nof being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon\\nthe violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which\\nhe digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back\\ninto its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to\\nsome place of shelter and let the county police know\\nwhat has happened.”\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from\\nthe dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round\\nthe reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and,\\ncarrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby\\nRoylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I\\nshould prolong a narrative which has already run to\\ntoo great a length by telling how we broke the sad\\nnews to the terriﬁed girl, how we conveyed her by\\nthe morning train to the care of her good aunt at Har-\\nrow, of how the slow process of ofﬁcial inquiry came\\nto the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little\\nwhich I had yet to learn of the case was told me by\\nSherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous\\nconclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dan-\\ngerous it always is to reason from insufﬁcient data.\\nThe presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\\n‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt,\\nto explain the appearance which she had caught a\\nhurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were\\nsufﬁcient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered\\nmy position when, however, it became clear to me\\nthat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the\\nroom could not come either from the window or the\\ndoor. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the\\nbell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery\\nthat this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped\\nto the ﬂoor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that\\nthe rope was there as a bridge for something pass-\\ning through the hole and coming to the bed. The\\nidea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when\\nI coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was\\nfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I\\nfelt that I was probably on the right track. The idea\\nof using a form of poison which could not possibly\\nbe discovered by any chemical test was just such a\\none as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who\\nhad had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which\\nsuch a poison would take effect would also, from his\\npoint of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-\\neyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two\\nlittle dark punctures which would show where the\\npoison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of\\nthe whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before\\nthe morning light revealed it to the victim. He had\\ntrained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\\nsaw, to return to him when summoned.

Of\\nthese the latter may have afforded a ﬁner ﬁeld for\\nan acute and original observer, but the other was so\\nstrange in its inception and so dramatic in its details\\nthat it may be the more worthy of being placed upon\\nrecord, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for\\nthose deductive methods of reasoning by which he\\nachieved such remarkable results. The story has, I\\nbelieve, been told more than once in the newspapers,\\nbut, like all such narratives, its effect is much less\\nstriking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column\\nof print than when the facts slowly evolve before your\\nown eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as\\neach new discovery furnishes a step which leads on\\nto the complete truth. At the time the circumstances\\nmade a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of\\ntwo years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my mar-\\nriage, that the events occurred which I am now about\\nto summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had\\nﬁnally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms,\\nalthough I continually visited him and occasionally\\neven persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so\\nfar as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily\\nincreased, and as I happened to live at no very great\\ndistance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients\\nfrom among the ofﬁcials. One of these, whom I had\\ncured of a painful and lingering disease, was never\\nweary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring\\nto send me on every sufferer over whom he might\\nhave any inﬂuence.\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I\\nwas awakened by the maid tapping at the door to\\nannounce that two men had come from Paddington\\nand were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed\\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases\\nwere seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I\\ndescended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the\\nroom and closed the door tightly behind him.\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.”\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner sug-\\ngested that it was some strange creature which he\\nhad caged up in my room.\\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d\\nbring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away.\\nThere he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor;\\nI have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off he\\nwent, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to\\nthank him.\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentle-\\nman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in\\na suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which\\nhe had laid down upon my books. Round one of his\\nhands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was\\nmottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not\\nmore than ﬁve-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,\\nmasculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave\\nme the impression of a man who was suffering from\\nsome strong agitation, which it took all his strength\\nof mind to control.\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said\\nhe, “but I have had a very serious accident during\\nthe night. I came in by train this morning, and on\\ninquiring at Paddington as to where I might ﬁnd a\\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.\\nI gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it\\nupon the side-table.”\\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hather-\\nley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street ( 3rd\\nﬂoor).” That was the name, style, and abode of my\\nmorning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you wait-\\ning,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You\\nare fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is\\nin itself a monotonous occupation.”\\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,”\\nsaid he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with\\na high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and\\nshaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up\\nagainst that laugh.\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I\\npoured out some water from a caraffe.\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those\\nhysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature\\nwhen some great crisis is over and gone. Presently\\nhe came to himself once more, very weary and pale-\\nlooking.\\n“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.\\n“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy\\ninto the water, and the colour began to come back to\\nhis bloodless cheeks.\\n“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, per-\\nhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather\\nto the place where my thumb used to be.”\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his\\nhand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to\\nlook at it. There were four protruding ﬁngers and a\\nhorrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should\\n109'),\n",

Would you give me an introduction to\\nhim?”\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be\\nin time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you\\nfeel equal to it?”\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my\\nstory.”\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be\\nwith you in an instant.” I rushed upstairs, explained\\nthe matter shortly to my wife, and in ﬁve minutes was\\ninside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance\\nto Baker Street.\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging\\nabout his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, read-\\ning the agony column of The Times and smoking his\\nbefore-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the\\nplugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day be-\\nfore, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of\\nthe mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial\\nfashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined\\nus in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he set-\\ntled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a\\npillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy\\nand water within his reach.\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no\\ncommon one, Mr. Hatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down\\nthere and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us\\nwhat you can, but stop when you are tired and keep\\nup your strength with a little stimulant.”\\n“Thank you,” said my patient. “but I have felt an-\\nother man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think\\nthat your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall\\ntake up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary,\\nheavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and\\neager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we lis-\\ntened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\\ndetailed to us.\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan\\nand a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London.\\nBy profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have\\nhad considerable experience of my work during the\\nseven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Math-\\neson, the well-known ﬁrm, of Greenwich.

My\\ngross takings amount to £27 10s. Every day, from nine\\nin the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited\\nin my little den, until at last my heart began to sink,\\nand I came to believe that I should never have any\\npractice at all.\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leav-\\ning the ofﬁce, my clerk entered to say there was a\\ngentleman waiting who wished to see me upon busi-\\nness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of\\n‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at\\nhis heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over\\nthe middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do\\nnot think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His\\nwhole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and\\nthe skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his\\noutstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be\\nhis natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye\\nwas bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He\\nwas plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should\\njudge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\\n“ ‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a\\nGerman accent. ‘You have been recommended to me,\\nMr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proﬁ-\\ncient in his profession but is also discreet and capable\\nof preserving a secret.’\\n“I bowed, feeling as ﬂattered as any young man\\nwould at such an address. ‘May I ask who it was who\\ngave me so good a character?’\\n“ ‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell\\nyou that just at this moment. I have it from the same\\nsource that you are both an orphan and a bachelor\\nand are residing alone in London.’\\n“ ‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will\\nexcuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears\\nupon my professional qualiﬁcations. I understand\\nthat it was on a professional matter that you wished\\nto speak to me?’\\n“ ‘Undoubtedly so. But you will ﬁnd that all I\\nsay is really to the point. I have a professional com-\\nmission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essen-\\ntial—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course\\nwe may expect that more from a man who is alone\\nthan from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’\\n“ ‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may\\nabsolutely depend upon my doing so.’\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it\\nseemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and\\nquestioning an eye.\\n“ ‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\\n“ ‘Yes, I promise.’\\n“ ‘Absolute and complete silence before, during,\\nand after? No reference to the matter at all, either in\\nword or writing?’\\n“ ‘I have already given you my word.’\\n“ ‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and dart-\\ning like lightning across the room he ﬂung open the\\ndoor. The passage outside was empty.\\n“ ‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know\\nthat clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s\\naffairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his\\nchair very close to mine and began to stare at me\\nagain with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to\\nfear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics\\nof this ﬂeshless man. Even my dread of losing a client\\ncould not restrain me from showing my impatience.\\n“ ‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said\\nI; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that\\nlast sentence, but the words came to my lips.\\n“ ‘How would ﬁfty guineas for a night’s work suit\\nyou?’ he asked.\\n“ ‘Most admirably.’\\n“ ‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be\\nnearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about\\na hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of\\ngear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon\\nset it right ourselves. What do you think of such a\\ncommission as that?’\\n“ ‘The work appears to be light and the pay mu-\\nniﬁcent.’\\n“ ‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night\\nby the last train.’\\n“ ‘Where to?’\\n“ ‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near\\nthe borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles\\nof Reading. There is a train from Paddington which\\nwould bring you there at about 11.15.’\\n“ ‘Very good.’\\n“ ‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\\n“ ‘There is a drive, then?’\\n“ ‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It\\nis a good seven miles from Eyford Station.’\\n“ ‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I\\nsuppose there would be no chance of a train back.

Still, of course, if you\\nwould like to draw out of the business, there is plenty\\nof time to do so.’\\n“I thought of the ﬁfty guineas, and of how very\\nuseful they would be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I\\nshall be very happy to accommodate myself to your\\nwishes. I should like, however, to understand a little\\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\\n“ ‘Quite so.

You are probably\\naware that fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and\\nthat it is only found in one or two places in England?’\\n“ ‘I have heard so.’\\n“ ‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a\\nvery small place—within ten miles of Reading. I was\\nfortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit\\nof fuller’s-earth in one of my ﬁelds. On examining\\nit, however, I found that this deposit was a compara-\\ntively small one, and that it formed a link between two\\nvery much larger ones upon the right and left—both\\nof them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours.\\nThese good people were absolutely ignorant that their\\nland contained that which was quite as valuable as\\na gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy\\ntheir land before they discovered its true value, but\\nunfortunately I had no capital by which I could do\\nthis. I took a few of my friends into the secret, how-\\never, and they suggested that we should quietly and\\nsecretly work our own little deposit and that in this\\nway we should earn the money which would enable\\nus to buy the neighbouring ﬁelds. This we have now\\nbeen doing for some time, and in order to help us\\nin our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This\\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order,\\nand we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard\\nour secret very jealously, however, and if it once be-\\ncame known that we had hydraulic engineers coming\\nto our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and\\nthen, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to\\nany chance of getting these ﬁelds and carrying out\\nour plans. That is why I have made you promise\\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are\\ngoing to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all\\nplain?’\\n“ ‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which\\nI could not quite understand was what use you could\\nmake of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth,\\nwhich, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a\\npit.’\\n“ ‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own pro-\\ncess. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to\\nremove them without revealing what they are. But\\nthat is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my\\nconﬁdence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you\\nhow I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect\\nyou, then, at Eyford at 11.15.’\\n“ ‘I shall certainly be there.’\\n“ ‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me\\nwith a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing\\nmy hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the\\nroom.\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool\\nblood I was very much astonished, as you may both\\nthink, at this sudden commission which had been\\nintrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was\\nglad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should\\nhave asked had I set a price upon my own services,\\nand it was possible that this order might lead to other\\nones. On the other hand, the face and manner of\\nmy patron had made an unpleasant impression upon\\nme, and I could not think that his explanation of the\\nfuller’s-earth was sufﬁcient to explain the necessity\\nfor my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety\\nlest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I\\nthrew all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove\\nto Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the\\nletter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage\\nbut my station. However, I was in time for the last\\ntrain to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station\\nafter eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got\\nout there, and there was no one upon the platform\\nsave a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed\\nout through the wicket gate, however, I found my\\nacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\\nupon the other side. Without a word he grasped my\\narm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which\\nwas standing open. He drew up the windows on ei-\\nther side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we\\nwent as fast as the horse could go.”\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\n“Yes, only one.”\\n“Did you observe the colour?”\\n112'),\n",

It was a chestnut.”\\n“Tired-looking or fresh?”\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you.\\nPray continue your most interesting statement.”\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least\\nan hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was\\nonly seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took,\\nthat it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my\\nside in silence all the time, and I was aware, more\\nthan once when I glanced in his direction, that he\\nwas looking at me with great intensity. The country\\nroads seem to be not very good in that part of the\\nworld, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to\\nlook out of the windows to see something of where\\nwe were, but they were made of frosted glass, and\\nI could make out nothing save the occasional bright\\nblur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded\\nsome remark to break the monotony of the journey,\\nbut the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and\\nthe conversation soon ﬂagged. At last, however, the\\nbumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp\\nsmoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came\\nto a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and,\\nas I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch\\nwhich gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were,\\nright out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\\nfailed to catch the most ﬂeeting glance of the front of\\nthe house. The instant that I had crossed the thresh-\\nold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard\\nfaintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove\\naway.\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the\\ncolonel fumbled about looking for matches and mut-\\ntering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at\\nthe other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar\\nof light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and\\na woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which\\nshe held above her head, pushing her face forward\\nand peering at us. I could see that she was pretty,\\nand from the gloss with which the light shone upon\\nher dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She\\nspoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as\\nthough asking a question, and when my companion\\nanswered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a\\nstart that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel\\nStark went up to her, whispered something in her\\near, and then, pushing her back into the room from\\nwhence she had come, he walked towards me again\\nwith the lamp in his hand.\\n“ ‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in\\nthis room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open\\nanother door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished\\nroom, with a round table in the centre, on which sev-\\neral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid\\ndown the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the\\ndoor. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said\\nhe, and vanished into the darkness.\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in\\nspite of my ignorance of German I could see that two\\nof them were treatises on science, the others being\\nvolumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the win-\\ndow, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the\\ncountry-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was\\nfolded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house.\\nThere was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in\\nthe passage, but otherwise everything was deadly\\nstill. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal\\nover me. Who were these German people, and what\\nwere they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way\\nplace? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so\\nfrom Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north,\\nsouth, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,\\nReading, and possibly other large towns, were within\\nthat radius, so the place might not be so secluded,\\nafter all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute\\nstillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and\\ndown the room, humming a tune under my breath to\\nkeep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly\\nearning my ﬁfty-guinea fee.\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the\\nmidst of the utter stillness, the door of my room\\nswung slowly open. The woman was standing in\\nthe aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager\\nand beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she\\nwas sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my\\nown heart. She held up one shaking ﬁnger to warn\\nme to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words\\nof broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like\\nthose of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind\\nher.\\n“ ‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed\\nto me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay\\nhere. There is no good for you to do.’\\n“ ‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I\\ncame for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the\\nmachine.’\\n“ ‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on.\\n‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And\\nthen, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she\\nsuddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\\n113'),\n",

It was\\na labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages,\\nnarrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the\\nthresholds of which were hollowed out by the gen-\\nerations who had crossed them. There were no car-\\npets and no signs of any furniture above the ground\\nﬂoor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and\\nthe damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy\\nblotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as\\npossible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the\\nlady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a\\nkeen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson ap-\\npeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could\\nsee from the little that he said that he was at least a\\nfellow-countryman.\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a\\nlow door, which he unlocked. Within was a small,\\nsquare room, in which the three of us could hardly\\nget at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\\ncolonel ushered me in.\\n“ ‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hy-\\ndraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleas-\\nant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The\\nceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force\\nof many tons upon this metal ﬂoor. There are small\\nlateral columns of water outside which receive the\\nforce, and which transmit and multiply it in the man-\\nner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily\\nenough, but there is some stiffness in the working of\\nit, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will\\nhave the goodness to look it over and to show us how\\nwe can set it right.’\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the\\nmachine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic\\none, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.\\nWhen I passed outside, however, and pressed down\\nthe levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the\\nwhishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which\\nallowed a regurgitation of water through one of the\\nside cylinders. An examination showed that one of\\nthe india-rubber bands which was round the head of\\na driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to ﬁll the\\nsocket along which it worked. This was clearly the\\ncause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully\\nand asked several practical questions as to how they\\nshould proceed to set it right. When I had made it\\nclear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own\\ncuriosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story\\nof the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for\\nit would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.\\nThe walls were of wood, but the ﬂoor consisted of\\na large iron trough, and when I came to examine it\\nI could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly\\nwhat it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in\\n114'),\n",

His face set hard, and a\\nbaleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n“ ‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about\\nthe machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the\\nlittle door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed\\ntowards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and\\nshoves. ‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me\\nout!’\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound\\nwhich sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank\\nof the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He\\nhad set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon\\nthe ﬂoor where I had placed it when examining the\\ntrough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was\\ncoming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none\\nknew better than myself, with a force which must\\nwithin a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw\\nmyself, screaming, against the door, and dragged\\nwith my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to\\nlet me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers\\ndrowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two\\nabove my head, and with my hand upraised I could\\nfeel its hard, rough surface. Then it ﬂashed through\\nmy mind that the pain of my death would depend\\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay\\non my face the weight would come upon my spine,\\nand I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier\\nthe other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie\\nand look up at that deadly black shadow wavering\\ndown upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect,\\nwhen my eye caught something which brought a gush\\nof hope back to my heart.\\n“I have said that though the ﬂoor and ceiling were\\nof iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hur-\\nried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light\\nbetween two of the boards, which broadened and\\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward.\\nFor an instant I could hardly believe that here was\\nindeed a door which led away from death. The next\\ninstant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting\\nupon the other side. The panel had closed again\\nbehind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few mo-\\nments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at\\nmy wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone\\nﬂoor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over\\nme and tugged at me with her left hand, while she\\nheld a candle in her right. It was the same good friend\\nwhose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\\n“ ‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will\\nbe here in a moment. They will see that you are not\\nthere. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but\\ncome!’\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.\\nI staggered to my feet and ran with her along the\\ncorridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we\\nheard the sound of running feet and the shouting of\\ntwo voices, one answering the other from the ﬂoor on\\nwhich we were and from the one beneath. My guide\\nstopped and looked about her like one who is at her\\nwit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led into\\na bedroom, through the window of which the moon\\nwas shining brightly.\\n“ ‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but\\nit may be that you can jump it.’\\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the fur-\\nther end of the passage, and I saw the lean ﬁgure\\nof Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a\\nlantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s\\ncleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,\\nﬂung open the window, and looked out. How quiet\\nand sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the\\nmoonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\\ndown. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to\\njump until I should have heard what passed between\\nmy saviour and the rufﬁan who pursued me. If she\\nwere ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\\ngo back to her assistance. The thought had hardly\\nﬂashed through my mind before he was at the door,\\npushing his way past her; but she threw her arms\\nround him and tried to hold him back.\\n“ ‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember\\nyour promise after the last time. You said it should\\nnot be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’\\n“ ‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to\\nbreak away from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He\\nhas seen too much.

Suddenly, however, as I\\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.\\nI glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing\\npainfully, and then, for the ﬁrst time, saw that my\\nthumb had been cut off and that the blood was pour-\\ning from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my hand-\\nkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing\\nin my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint\\namong the rose-bushes.\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.\\nIt must have been a very long time, for the moon\\nhad sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I\\ncame to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from\\nmy wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in\\nan instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure,\\nand I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might\\nhardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my as-\\ntonishment, when I came to look round me, neither\\nhouse nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying\\nin an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and\\njust a little lower down was a long building, which\\nproved, upon my approaching it, to be the very sta-\\ntion at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\\nWere it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all\\nthat had passed during those dreadful hours might\\nhave been an evil dream.\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked\\nabout the morning train. There would be one to Read-\\ning in less than an hour. The same porter was on\\nduty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I\\ninquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel\\nLysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had\\nhe observed a carriage the night before waiting for\\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station any-\\nwhere near? There was one about three miles off.\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I\\nwas. I determined to wait until I got back to town\\nbefore telling my story to the police. It was a little\\npast six when I arrived, so I went ﬁrst to have my\\nwound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough\\nto bring me along here. I put the case into your hands\\nand shall do exactly what you advise.”\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after\\nlistening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sher-\\nlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the\\nponderous commonplace books in which he placed\\nhis cuttings.\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,”\\nsaid he. “It appeared in all the papers about a year\\nago. Listen to this:\\n“ ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah\\nHayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engi-\\nneer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night,\\nand has not been heard of since. Was dressed\\nin—’\\netc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the\\ncolonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\nfancy.”\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that\\nexplains what the girl said.”\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel\\nwas a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely\\ndetermined that nothing should stand in the way of\\nhis little game, like those out-and-out pirates who\\nwill leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,\\nevery moment now is precious, so if you feel equal\\nto it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a\\npreliminary to starting for Eyford.”\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in\\nthe train together, bound from Reading to the little\\nBerkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the\\nhydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland\\nYard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet\\nhad spread an ordnance map of the county out upon\\nthe seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a\\ncircle with Eyford for its centre.\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at\\na radius of ten miles from the village. The place we\\nwant must be somewhere near that line. You said ten\\nmiles, I think, sir.”\\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\\n“And you think that they brought you back all\\nthat way when you were unconscious?”\\n“They must have done so. I have a confused mem-\\nory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed some-\\nwhere.”\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they\\nshould have spared you when they found you lying\\nfainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was soft-\\nened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more\\ninexorable face in my life.”\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Brad-\\nstreet. “Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish\\nI knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in\\nsearch of are to be found.”\\n116'),\n",

Come, now, we shall see who\\nagrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is\\nmore deserted there.”\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man.\\n“There are several quiet little villages up there.”\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no\\nhills there, and our friend says that he did not notice\\nthe carriage go up any.”\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very\\npretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the com-\\npass among us. Who do you give your casting vote\\nto?”\\n“You are all wrong.”\\n“But we can’tall be.”\\n“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed\\nhis ﬁnger in the centre of the circle. “This is where\\nwe shall ﬁnd them.”\\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say\\nyourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when\\nyou got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve\\nmiles over heavy roads?”\\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Brad-\\nstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt\\nas to the nature of this gang.”\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on\\na large scale, and have used the machine to form the\\namalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang\\nwas at work,” said the inspector. “They have been\\nturning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even\\ntraced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther,\\nfor they had covered their traces in a way that showed\\nthat they were very old hands. But now, thanks to\\nthis lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\\nenough.”\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those crimi-\\nnals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice.\\nAs we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\\ncolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a\\nsmall clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung\\nlike an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\\n“A house on ﬁre?” asked Bradstreet as the train\\nsteamed off again on its way.\\n“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\\n“When did it break out?”\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has\\ngot worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.”\\n“Whose house is it?”\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\n“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a\\nGerman, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?”\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr.\\nBecher is an Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the\\nparish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has\\na gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I under-\\nstand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little\\ngood Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”\\nThe station-master had not ﬁnished his speech\\nbefore we were all hastening in the direction of the\\nﬁre. The road topped a low hill, and there was a\\ngreat widespread whitewashed building in front of\\nus, spouting ﬁre at every chink and window, while\\nin the garden in front three ﬁre-engines were vainly\\nstriving to keep the ﬂames under.\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.\\n“There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-\\nbushes where I lay. That second window is the one\\nthat I jumped from.”\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your\\nrevenge upon them. There can be no question that it\\nwas your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the\\npress, set ﬁre to the wooden walls, though no doubt\\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe\\nit at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd\\nfor your friends of last night, though I very much fear\\nthat they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from\\nthat day to this no word has ever been heard either\\nof the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the\\nmorose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant\\nhad met a cart containing several people and some\\nvery bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of\\nReading, but there all traces of the fugitives disap-\\npeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to\\ndiscover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\\nThe ﬁremen had been much perturbed at the\\nstrange arrangements which they had found within,\\nand still more so by discovering a newly severed hu-\\nman thumb upon a window-sill of the second ﬂoor.\\nAbout sunset, however, their efforts were at last suc-\\ncessful, and they subdued the ﬂames, but not before\\nthe roof had fallen in, and the whole place been re-\\nduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted\\ncylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of\\n117'),\n",

I read nothing except the criminal news\\nand the agony column. The latter is always instruc-\\ntive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his\\nwedding?”\\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”\\n“That is well.

Ah, here it is:\\n“ ‘There will soon be a call for protection in\\nthe marriage market, for the present free-trade\\nprinciple appears to tell heavily against our\\nhome product. One by one the management\\nof the noble houses of Great Britain is pass-\\ning into the hands of our fair cousins from\\nacross the Atlantic. An important addition\\nhas been made during the last week to the\\nlist of the prizes which have been borne away\\nby these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years\\nproof against the little god’s arrows, has now\\ndeﬁnitely announced his approaching mar-\\nriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating\\ndaughter of a California millionaire. Miss Do-\\nran, whose graceful ﬁgure and striking face at-\\ntracted much attention at the Westbury House\\nfestivities, is an only child, and it is currently\\nreported that her dowry will run to consider-\\nably over the six ﬁgures, with expectancies for\\nthe future. As it is an open secret that the\\nDuke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell\\nhis pictures within the last few years, and as\\nLord St. Simon has no property of his own\\nsave the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvi-\\nous that the Californian heiress is not the only\\ngainer by an alliance which will enable her to\\nmake the easy and common transition from a\\nRepublican lady to a British peeress.’ ”\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in\\nthe Morning Post to say that the marriage would\\nbe an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\\nGeorge’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen in-\\ntimate friends would be invited, and that the party\\nwould return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate\\nwhich has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two\\ndays later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a\\ncurt announcement that the wedding had taken place,\\nand that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord\\nBackwater’s place, near Petersﬁeld. Those are all the\\nnotices which appeared before the disappearance of\\nthe bride.”\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised\\nto be; quite dramatic, in fact.”\\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the com-\\nmon.”\\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occa-\\nsionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to\\nmind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me\\nhave the details.”\\n“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single\\narticle of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will\\nread to you.

The whole party proceeded af-\\nterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran,\\nat Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been\\nprepared. It appears that some little trouble\\nwas caused by a woman, whose name has not\\nbeen ascertained, who endeavoured to force\\nher way into the house after the bridal party,\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord\\nSt. Simon. It was only after a painful and\\nprolonged scene that she was ejected by the\\nbutler and the footman. The bride, who had\\nfortunately entered the house before this un-\\npleasant interruption, had sat down to break-\\nfast with the rest, when she complained of a\\nsudden indisposition and retired to her room.\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some\\ncomment, her father followed her, but learned\\nfrom her maid that she had only come up to\\nher chamber for an instant, caught up an ul-\\nster and bonnet, and hurried down to the pas-\\nsage. One of the footmen declared that he had\\nseen a lady leave the house thus apparelled,\\nbut had refused to credit that it was his mis-\\ntress, believing her to be with the company.\\nOn ascertaining that his daughter had disap-\\npeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction\\nwith the bridegroom, instantly put themselves\\nin communication with the police, and very\\nenergetic inquiries are being made, which will\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this\\nvery singular business. Up to a late hour last\\nnight, however, nothing had transpired as to\\nthe whereabouts of the missing lady. There\\nare rumours of foul play in the matter, and\\nit is said that the police have caused the ar-\\nrest of the woman who had caused the origi-\\nnal disturbance, in the belief that, from jeal-\\nousy or some other motive, she may have been\\nconcerned in the strange disappearance of the\\nbride.’ ”\\n“And is that all?”\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning\\npapers, but it is a suggestive one.”\\n“And it is—”\\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused\\nthe disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears\\nthat she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and\\nthat she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case\\nis in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth\\nin the public press.”\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to\\nbe. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is\\na ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a\\nfew minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will\\nprove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going,\\nWatson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if\\nonly as a check to my own memory.”\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy,\\nthrowing open the door. A gentleman entered, with\\na pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with\\nsomething perhaps of petulance about the mouth,\\nand with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose\\npleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be\\nobeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general\\nappearance gave an undue impression of age, for he\\nhad a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the\\nknees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off\\nhis very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\\nedges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was\\ncareful to the verge of foppishness, with high col-\\nlar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves,\\npatent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He\\nadvanced slowly into the room, turning his head from\\nleft to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord\\nwhich held his golden eyeglasses.\\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising\\nand bowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my\\nfriend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to\\nthe ﬁre, and we will talk this matter over.”\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most\\nreadily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the\\nquick. I understand that you have already managed\\nseveral delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I pre-\\nsume that they were hardly from the same class of\\nsociety.”\\n“No, I am descending.”\\n“I beg pardon.”\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\\n123'),\n",

Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg\\npardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you\\nany information which may assist you in forming an\\nopinion.”\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in\\nthe public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may\\ntake it as correct—this article, for example, as to the\\ndisappearance of the bride.”\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct,\\nas far as it goes.”\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before\\nanyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may\\narrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”\\n“Pray do so.”\\n“When did you ﬁrst meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\n“You were travelling in the States?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Did you become engaged then?”\\n“No.”\\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see\\nthat I was amused.”\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Paciﬁc\\nslope.”\\n“And how did he make his money?”\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then\\nhe struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and\\nbounds.”\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the\\nyoung lady’s—your wife’s character?”\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and\\nstared down into the ﬁre. “You see, Mr. Holmes,”\\nsaid he, “my wife was twenty before her father be-\\ncame a rich man. During that time she ran free in a\\nmining camp and wandered through woods or moun-\\ntains, so that her education has come from Nature\\nrather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we\\ncall in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild\\nand free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She\\nis impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is\\nswift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying\\nout her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not\\nhave given her the name which I have the honour\\nto bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had not I\\nthought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe\\nthat she is capable of heroic self-sacriﬁce and that\\nanything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and\\nshowed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It\\nwas not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and\\nthe artist had brought out the full effect of the lus-\\ntrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite\\nmouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then\\nhe closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St.\\nSimon.\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you\\nrenewed your acquaintance?”\\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last Lon-\\ndon season. I met her several times, became engaged\\nto her, and have now married her.”\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable\\ndowry?”\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my\\nfamily.”\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the\\nmarriage is a fait accompli?”\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on\\nthe day before the wedding?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Was she in good spirits?”\\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should\\ndo in our future lives.”\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the\\nmorning of the wedding?”\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after\\nthe ceremony.”\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the ﬁrst signs\\nthat I had ever seen that her temper was just a little\\nsharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate\\nand can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as\\nwe went towards the vestry. She was passing the front\\npew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There\\nwas a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\\nhanded it up to her again, and it did not appear to be\\nthe worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the\\nmatter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage,\\non our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over\\nthis triﬂing cause.”\\n124'),\n",

I hardly no-\\nticed his appearance. But really I think that we are\\nwandering rather far from the point.”\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding\\nin a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone\\nto it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s\\nhouse?”\\n“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\\n“And who is her maid?”\\n“Alice is her name. She is an American and came\\nfrom California with her.”\\n“A conﬁdential servant?”\\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her\\nmistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of\\ncourse, in America they look upon these things in a\\ndifferent way.”\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think\\nof.”\\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a\\nclaim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind.\\nI have no idea what she meant.”\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes.\\nAnd what did your wife do when she ﬁnished speak-\\ning to her maid?”\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\n“On your arm?”\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little\\nmatters like that. Then, after we had sat down for\\nten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some\\nwords of apology, and left the room. She never came\\nback.”\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes\\nthat she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress\\nwith a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walk-\\ning into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar,\\na woman who is now in custody, and who had al-\\nready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that\\nmorning.”\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this\\nyoung lady, and your relations to her.”\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised\\nhis eyebrows. “We have been on a friendly footing\\nfor some years—I may say on a very friendly foot-\\ning. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated\\nher ungenerously, and she had no just cause of com-\\nplaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr.\\nHolmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly\\nhot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote\\nme dreadful letters when she heard that I was about\\nto be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why\\nI had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I\\nfeared lest there might be a scandal in the church.\\nShe came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned,\\nand she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering\\nvery abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of\\nsomething of the sort, and I had two police fellows\\nthere in private clothes, who soon pushed her out\\nagain. She was quiet when she saw that there was no\\ngood in making a row.”\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman\\nafterwards?”\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,\\nlooks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora\\ndecoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for\\nher.”\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\n“You think so, too?”\\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not\\nyourself look upon this as likely?”\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a ﬂy.”\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of charac-\\nters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took\\nplace?”\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to pro-\\npound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you\\nask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to\\nme as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social\\nstride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\\ndisturbance in my wife.”\\n“In short, that she had become suddenly de-\\nranged?”\\n125'),\n",

With a short greeting he seated himself and lit\\nthe cigar which had been offered to him.\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle\\nin his eye. “You look dissatisﬁed.”\\n“And I feel dissatisﬁed. It is this infernal St. Simon\\nmarriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the\\nbusiness.”\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every\\nclue seems to slip through my ﬁngers.

Then he\\nturned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook\\nhis head solemnly, and hurried away.\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when\\nHolmes rose to put on his overcoat. “There is some-\\nthing in what the fellow says about outdoor work,”\\nhe remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave\\nyou to your papers for a little.”\\nIt was after ﬁve o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left\\nme, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour\\nthere arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large\\nﬂat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth\\nwhom he had brought with him, and presently, to\\nmy very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little\\ncold supper began to be laid out upon our humble\\nlodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of\\nbrace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pˆat´e de foie gras\\npie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles.\\nHaving laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors\\nvanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights,\\nwith no explanation save that the things had been\\npaid for and were ordered to this address.\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped\\nbriskly into the room. His features were gravely set,\\nbut there was a light in his eye which made me think\\nthat he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing\\nhis hands.\\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for\\nﬁve.”\\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company drop-\\nping in,” said he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon\\nhas not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his\\nstep now upon the stairs.”\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who\\ncame bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigor-\\nously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression\\nupon his aristocratic features.\\n127'),\n",

For my part, I should like\\nall Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He\\nwas a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with\\na sharp face and alert manner.\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady.\\n“Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near\\nthe Rockies, where pa was working a claim. We were\\nengaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while\\npoor Frank here had a claim that petered out and\\ncame to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was\\nFrank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement\\nlasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco.\\nFrank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he fol-\\nlowed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing\\nanything about it. It would only have made him mad\\nto know, so we just ﬁxed it all up for ourselves. Frank\\nsaid that he would go and make his pile, too, and\\nnever come back to claim me until he had as much\\nas pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end\\nof time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else\\nwhile he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right\\naway, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you;\\nand I won’t claim to be your husband until I come\\nback?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had ﬁxed it all\\nup so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,\\nthat we just did it right there; and then Frank went\\noff to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in\\nMontana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona,\\nand then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that\\ncame a long newspaper story about how a miners’\\ncamp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there\\nwas my Frank’s name among the killed.

We can’t command\\nour love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar\\nwith him with the intention to make him just as good\\na wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine\\nwhat I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I\\nglanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at\\nme out of the ﬁrst pew. I thought it was his ghost at\\nﬁrst; but when I looked again there he was still, with\\na kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether\\nI were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t\\ndrop. I know that everything was turning round, and\\nthe words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of\\na bee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should\\nI stop the service and make a scene in the church? I\\nglanced at him again, and he seemed to know what\\nI was thinking, for he raised his ﬁnger to his lips to\\ntell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece\\nof paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.\\nAs I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my\\nbouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my\\nhand when he returned me the ﬂowers. It was only a\\nline asking me to join him when he made the sign to\\nme to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\\nthat my ﬁrst duty was now to him, and I determined\\nto do just whatever he might direct.\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known\\nhim in California, and had always been his friend. I\\nordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things\\npacked and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have\\nspoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard\\nbefore his mother and all those great people. I just\\nmade up my mind to run away and explain after-\\nwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before\\nI saw Frank out of the window at the other side of\\nthe road. He beckoned to me and then began walking\\ninto the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something\\nor other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me\\nfrom the little I heard as if he had a little secret of\\nhis own before marriage also—but I managed to get\\naway from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into\\na cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings\\nhe had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true\\nwedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had\\nbeen a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped,\\ncame on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up for\\ndead and had gone to England, followed me there,\\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning\\nof my second wedding.”\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It\\ngave the name and the church but not where the lady\\nlived.”\\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and\\nFrank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed\\nof it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away\\nand never see any of them again—just sending a line\\nto pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was\\nawful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sit-\\nting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to\\ncome back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should\\nnot be traced, and dropped them away somewhere\\nwhere no one could ﬁnd them. It is likely that we\\nshould have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that\\nthis good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us\\nthis evening, though how he found us is more than I\\ncan think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that\\nwe should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we\\nwere so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance\\nof talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came\\nright away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert,\\nyou have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have\\ngiven you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\\nmeanly of me.”\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid\\nattitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and\\na compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom\\nto discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this\\npublic manner.”\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake\\nhands before I go?”\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.”\\nHe put out his hand and coldly grasped that which\\nshe extended to him.\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you\\nwould have joined us in a friendly supper.”\\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” re-\\nsponded his Lordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce\\nin these recent developments, but I can hardly be ex-\\npected to make merry over them. I think that with\\nyour permission I will now wish you all a very good-\\nnight.” He included us all in a sweeping bow and\\nstalked out of the room.\\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with\\nyour company,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a\\njoy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one\\nof those who believe that the folly of a monarch and\\nthe blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not\\nprevent our children from being some day citizens\\nof the same world-wide country under a ﬂag which\\n129'),\n",

Nothing could be more natural\\nthan the sequence of events as narrated by this lady,\\nand nothing stranger than the result when viewed,\\nfor instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\n“From the ﬁrst, two facts were very obvious to\\nme, the one that the lady had been quite willing to\\nundergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she\\nhad repented of it within a few minutes of returning\\nhome. Obviously something had occurred during the\\nmorning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What\\ncould that something be? She could not have spoken\\nto anyone when she was out, for she had been in the\\ncompany of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone,\\nthen? If she had, it must be someone from America\\nbecause she had spent so short a time in this country\\nthat she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire\\nso deep an inﬂuence over her that the mere sight of\\nhim would induce her to change her plans so com-\\npletely. You see we have already arrived, by a process\\nof exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\\nAmerican. Then who could this American be, and\\nwhy should he possess so much inﬂuence over her?\\nIt might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young\\nwomanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes\\nand under strange conditions. So far I had got before\\nI ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told\\nus of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s\\nmanner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a\\nnote as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\\nconﬁdential maid, and of her very signiﬁcant allusion\\nto claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means\\ntaking possession of that which another person has a\\nprior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely\\nclear. She had gone off with a man, and the man\\nwas either a lover or was a previous husband—the\\nchances being in favour of the latter.”\\n“And how in the world did you ﬁnd them?”\\n“It might have been difﬁcult, but friend Lestrade\\nheld information in his hands the value of which he\\ndid not himself know. The initials were, of course, of\\nthe highest importance, but more valuable still was it\\nto know that within a week he had settled his bill at\\none of the most select London hotels.”\\n“How did you deduce the select?”\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and\\neightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the\\nmost expensive hotels. There are not many in London\\nwhich charge at that rate. In the second one which I\\nvisited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an\\ninspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an\\nAmerican gentleman, had left only the day before,\\nand on looking over the entries against him, I came\\nupon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate\\nbill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon\\nSquare; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate\\nenough to ﬁnd the loving couple at home, I ventured\\nto give them some paternal advice and to point out\\nto them that it would be better in every way that they\\nshould make their position a little clearer both to the\\ngeneral public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I\\nmade him keep the appointment.”\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His\\nconduct was certainly not very gracious.”\\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps\\nyou would not be very gracious either, if, after all the\\ntrouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself\\ndeprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully\\nand thank our stars that we are never likely to ﬁnd\\nourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up\\nand hand me my violin, for the only problem we\\nhave still to solve is how to while away these bleak\\nautumnal evenings.”\\n130'),\n",

It was a bright, crisp Febru-\\nary morning, and the snow of the day before still lay\\ndeep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the\\nwintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had\\nbeen ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the\\ntrafﬁc, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges\\nof the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell.\\nThe grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped,\\nbut was still dangerously slippery, so that there were\\nfewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direc-\\ntion of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming\\nsave the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct\\nhad drawn my attention.\\nHe was a man of about ﬁfty, tall, portly, and im-\\nposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a\\ncommanding ﬁgure. He was dressed in a sombre\\nyet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet\\nhis actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of\\nhis dress and features, for he was running hard, with\\noccasional little springs, such as a weary man gives\\nwho is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs.\\nAs he ran he jerked his hands up and down, wag-\\ngled his head, and writhed his face into the most\\nextraordinary contortions.\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?”\\nI asked. “He is looking up at the numbers of the\\nhouses.”\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes,\\nrubbing his hands.\\n“Here?”\\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me\\nprofessionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms.\\nHa! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man, puff-\\ning and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at\\nour bell until the whole house resounded with the\\nclanging.\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still\\npufﬁng, still gesticulating, but with so ﬁxed a look\\nof grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while\\nhe could not get his words out, but swayed his body\\nand plucked at his hair like one who has been driven\\nto the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly\\nspringing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall\\nwith such force that we both rushed upon him and\\ntore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock\\nHolmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and,\\nsitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with\\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well\\nhow to employ.\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you\\nnot?” said he. “You are fatigued with your haste.\\nPray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then\\nI shall be most happy to look into any little problem\\nwhich you may submit to me.”\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving\\nchest, ﬁghting against his emotion.

One of our most lucra-\\ntive means of laying out money is in the shape of\\nloans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have\\ndone a good deal in this direction during the last few\\nyears, and there are many noble families to whom we\\nhave advanced large sums upon the security of their\\npictures, libraries, or plate.\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my ofﬁce at\\nthe bank when a card was brought in to me by one\\nof the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it\\nwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to\\nyou I had better say no more than that it was a name\\nwhich is a household word all over the earth—one of\\nthe highest, noblest, most exalted names in England.\\nI was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted,\\nwhen he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once\\ninto business with the air of a man who wishes to\\nhurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\n“ ‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that\\nyou are in the habit of advancing money.’\\n“ ‘The ﬁrm does so when the security is good.’ I\\nanswered.\\n“ ‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I\\nshould have £50,000 at once. I could, of course, bor-\\nrow so triﬂing a sum ten times over from my friends,\\nbut I much prefer to make it a matter of business and\\nto carry out that business myself. In my position you\\ncan readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s\\nself under obligations.’\\n“ ‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’\\nI asked.\\n“ ‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and\\nI shall then most certainly repay what you advance,\\nwith whatever interest you think it right to charge.\\nBut it is very essential to me that the money should\\nbe paid at once.’\\n“ ‘I should be happy to advance it without further\\nparley from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it\\nnot that the strain would be rather more than it could\\nbear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name\\nof the ﬁrm, then in justice to my partner I must insist\\nthat, even in your case, every businesslike precaution\\nshould be taken.’\\n“ ‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, rais-\\ning up a square, black morocco case which he had\\nlaid beside his chair. ‘You have doubtless heard of the\\nBeryl Coronet?’\\n“ ‘One of the most precious public possessions of\\nthe empire,’ said I.\\n“ ‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbed-\\nded in soft, ﬂesh-coloured velvet, lay the magniﬁcent\\npiece of jewellery which he had named. ‘There are\\nthirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price\\nof the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest esti-\\nmate would put the worth of the coronet at double\\nthe sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it\\nwith you as my security.’\\n“I took the precious case into my hands and\\nlooked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious\\nclient.\\n“ ‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\n“ ‘Not at all.

With this intention, I called a cab and drove out\\nto my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me.\\nI did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs\\nand locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr.\\nHolmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand\\nthe situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the\\nhouse, and may be set aside altogether. I have three\\nmaid-servants who have been with me a number of\\nyears and whose absolute reliability is quite above sus-\\npicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came\\nwith an excellent character, however, and has always\\ngiven me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has\\nattracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\\nthe place. That is the only drawback which we have\\nfound to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly\\ngood girl in every way.\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so\\nsmall that it will not take me long to describe it. I am\\na widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been\\na disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous dis-\\nappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to\\nblame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very\\nlikely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he\\nwas all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never\\ndenied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better\\nfor both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for\\nthe best.\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should suc-\\nceed me in my business, but he was not of a business\\nturn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth,\\nI could not trust him in the handling of large sums of\\nmoney. When he was young he became a member of\\nan aristocratic club, and there, having charming man-\\nners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men\\nwith long purses and expensive habits. He learned\\nto play heavily at cards and to squander money on\\nthe turf, until he had again and again to come to me\\nand implore me to give him an advance upon his al-\\nlowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He\\ntried more than once to break away from the danger-\\nous company which he was keeping, but each time\\nthe inﬂuence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was\\nenough to draw him back again.\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man\\nas Sir George Burnwell should gain an inﬂuence over\\nhim, for he has frequently brought him to my house,\\nand I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a\\nman of the world to his ﬁnger-tips, one who had been\\neverywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and\\na man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of\\nhim in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his\\npresence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and\\nthe look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one\\nwho should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,\\ntoo, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick\\ninsight into character.\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She\\nis my niece; but when my brother died ﬁve years ago\\nand left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She\\nis a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful,\\na wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender\\nand quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my\\nright hand. I do not know what I could do without\\nher. In only one matter has she ever gone against my\\nwishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for\\nhe loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused\\nhim. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into\\nthe right path it would have been she, and that his\\nmarriage might have changed his whole life; but now,\\nalas! it is too late—forever too late!\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who\\nlive under my roof, and I shall continue with my\\nmiserable story.\\n“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room\\nthat night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my\\nexperience, and of the precious treasure which we\\nhad under our roof, suppressing only the name of\\nmy client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee,\\nhad, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that\\nthe door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much\\ninterested and wished to see the famous coronet, but\\nI thought it better not to disturb it.\\n“ ‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\n“ ‘In my own bureau.’\\n“ ‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be\\nburgled during the night.’ said he.\\n“ ‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\\n“ ‘Oh, any old key will ﬁt that bureau. When I was\\na youngster I have opened it myself with the key of\\nthe box-room cupboard.’\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I\\nthought little of what he said. He followed me to my\\nroom, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n“ ‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down,\\n‘can you let me have£200?’\\n135'),\n",

I am not a very\\nheavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no\\ndoubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two\\nin the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound\\nin the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake,\\nbut it had left an impression behind it as though a\\nwindow had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening\\nwith all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a\\ndistinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next\\nroom. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,\\nand peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\\ndoor.\\n“ ‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief!\\nHow dare you touch that coronet?’\\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my un-\\nhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was\\nstanding beside the light, holding the coronet in his\\nhands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from\\nhis grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it\\nup and examined it. One of the gold corners, with\\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n“ ‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with\\nrage. ‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured\\nme forever! Where are the jewels which you have\\nstolen?’\\n“ ‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\n“ ‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoul-\\nder.\\n“ ‘There are none missing. There cannot be any\\nmissing,’ said he.\\n“ ‘There are three missing. And you know where\\nthey are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did\\nI not see you trying to tear off another piece?’\\n“ ‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I\\nwill not stand it any longer. I shall not say another\\nword about this business, since you have chosen to\\ninsult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\\nmake my own way in the world.’\\n“ ‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I\\ncried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this\\nmatter probed to the bottom.’\\n“ ‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a\\npassion such as I should not have thought was in his\\nnature. ‘If you choose to call the police, let the police\\nﬁnd what they can.’\\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had\\nraised my voice in my anger. Mary was the ﬁrst to\\nrush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet\\nand of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and,\\nwith a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I\\nsent the house-maid for the police and put the inves-\\ntigation into their hands at once.

She is four-and-twenty.”\\n“This matter, from what you say, seems to have\\nbeen a shock to her also.”\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to your\\nson’s guilt?”\\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own\\neyes with the coronet in his hands.”\\n“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof.

You are doing what you can for\\nhim and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was\\nhe doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent,\\nwhy did he not say so?”\\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not\\ninvent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both\\nways. There are several singular points about the case.\\nWhat did the police think of the noise which awoke\\nyou from your sleep?”\\n“They considered that it might be caused by\\nArthur’s closing his bedroom door.”\\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would\\nslam his door so as to wake a household. What did\\nthey say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?”\\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing\\nthe furniture in the hope of ﬁnding them.”\\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy.

I confess that\\nthe guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as\\nobvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had\\nsuch faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there\\nmust be some grounds for hope as long as he was\\ndissatisﬁed with the accepted explanation. He hardly\\nspoke a word the whole way out to the southern sub-\\nurb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his\\nhat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\\nOur client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the\\nlittle glimpse of hope which had been presented to\\nhim, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me\\nover his business affairs. A short railway journey and\\na shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\\nresidence of the great ﬁnancier.\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white\\nstone, standing back a little from the road. A dou-\\nble carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched\\ndown in front to two large iron gates which closed\\nthe entrance. On the right side was a small wooden\\nthicket, which led into a narrow path between two\\nneat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen\\ndoor, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the\\nleft ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not\\nitself within the grounds at all, being a public, though\\nlittle used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing\\nat the door and walked slowly all round the house,\\nacross the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and\\nso round by the garden behind into the stable lane.\\nSo long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the\\ndining-room and waited by the ﬁre until he should\\nreturn. We were sitting there in silence when the door\\nopened and a young lady came in. She was rather\\nabove the middle height, slim, with dark hair and\\neyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute\\npallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen\\nsuch deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too,\\nwere bloodless, but her eyes were ﬂushed with crying.\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me\\nwith a greater sense of grief than the banker had done\\nin the morning, and it was the more striking in her as\\nshe was evidently a woman of strong character, with\\nimmense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my\\npresence, she went straight to her uncle and passed\\nher hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be\\nliberated, have you not, dad?” she asked.\\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to\\nthe bottom.”\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know\\nwhat woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done\\nno harm and that you will be sorry for having acted\\nso harshly.”\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry\\nthat you should suspect him.”\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually\\nsaw him with the coronet in his hand?”\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh,\\ndo, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let\\nthe matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to\\nthink of our dear Arthur in a prison!”\\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are\\nfound—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds\\nyou as to the awful consequences to me. Far from\\nhushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman\\ndown from London to inquire more deeply into it.”\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone.\\nHe is round in the stable lane now.”\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows.\\n“What can he hope to ﬁnd there? Ah! this, I suppose,\\nis he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving,\\nwhat I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is\\ninnocent of this crime.”\\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you,\\nthat we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to\\nthe mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “I believe\\nI have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\nMight I ask you a question or two?”\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible\\naffair up.”\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak\\nloudly. I heard that, and I came down.”\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night\\nbefore. Did you fasten all the windows?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\n“Yes.”\\n138'),\n",

Perhaps I had better take a look at\\nthe lower windows before I go up.”\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other,\\npausing only at the large one which looked from the\\nhall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a\\nvery careful examination of the sill with his powerful\\nmagnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he\\nat last.\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly fur-\\nnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bu-\\nreau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau\\nﬁrst and looked hard at the lock.\\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of\\nthe cupboard of the lumber-room.”\\n“Have you it here?”\\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bu-\\nreau.\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder\\nthat it did not wake you. This case, I presume, con-\\ntains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He\\nopened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\\nupon the table. It was a magniﬁcent specimen of the\\njeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the ﬁnest\\nthat I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was\\na cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems\\nhad been torn away.\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the cor-\\nner which corresponds to that which has been so\\nunfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it\\noff.”\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream\\nof trying,” said he.\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength\\nupon it, but without result. “I feel it give a little,”\\nsaid he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in\\nthe ﬁngers, it would take me all my time to break\\nit. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do\\nyou think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder?\\nThere would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell\\nme that all this happened within a few yards of your\\nbed and that you heard nothing of it?”\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What\\ndo you think, Miss Holder?”\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you\\nsaw him?”\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and\\nshirt.”\\n“Thank you.

I shall look into the matter between\\nthis and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may\\nhave to come over here again before evening.”\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind\\nwas now made up about the case, although what his\\nconclusions were was more than I could even dimly\\nimagine. Several times during our homeward journey\\nI endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he\\nalways glided away to some other topic, until at last I\\ngave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we\\nfound ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried\\nto his chamber and was down again in a few minutes\\ndressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned\\nup, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn\\nboots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing\\ninto the glass above the ﬁreplace. “I only wish that\\nyou could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it\\nwon’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I\\nmay be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon\\nknow which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few\\nhours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon\\nthe sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\\nbread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket\\nhe started off upon his expedition.\\nI had just ﬁnished my tea when he returned, ev-\\nidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-\\nsided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a\\ncorner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am\\ngoing right on.”\\n“Where to?”\\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be\\nsome time before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in\\ncase I should be late.”\\n“How are you getting on?”\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been\\nout to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call\\nat the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I\\nwould not have missed it for a good deal. However, I\\nmust not sit gossiping here, but must get these disrep-\\nutable clothes off and return to my highly respectable\\nself.”\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger\\nreasons for satisfaction than his words alone would\\nimply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch\\nof colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened up-\\nstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the\\nhall door, which told me that he was off once more\\nupon his congenial hunt.\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of\\nhis return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncom-\\nmon thing for him to be away for days and nights on\\nend when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness\\ncaused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour\\nhe came in, but when I came down to breakfast in\\nthe morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one\\nhand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as\\npossible.\\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Wat-\\nson,” said he, “but you remember that our client has\\nrather an early appointment this morning.”\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should\\nnot be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a\\nring.”\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the ﬁnancier. I was\\nshocked by the change which had come over him, for\\nhis face which was naturally of a broad and massive\\nmould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair\\nseemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered\\nwith a weariness and lethargy which was even more\\npainful than his violence of the morning before, and\\nhe dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed\\nforward for him.\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely\\ntried,” said he. “Only two days ago I was a happy\\nand prosperous man, without a care in the world.\\nNow I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One\\nsorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My\\nniece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\n“Deserted you?”\\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in,\\nher room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the\\nhall table.

In the middle of the\\nnight he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\\nand, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin\\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she\\ndisappeared into your dressing-room. Petriﬁed with\\nastonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and\\nwaited there in the dark to see what would come of\\nthis strange affair. Presently she emerged from the\\nroom again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your\\nson saw that she carried the precious coronet in her\\nhands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain\\nnear your door, whence he could see what passed in\\nthe hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the win-\\ndow, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom,\\nand then closing it once more hurry back to her room,\\npassing quite close to where he stood hid behind the\\ncurtain.\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take\\nany action without a horrible exposure of the woman\\nwhom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he\\nrealised how crushing a misfortune this would be for\\nyou, and how all-important it was to set it right. He\\nrushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened\\nthe window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down\\nthe lane, where he could see a dark ﬁgure in the\\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but\\nArthur caught him, and there was a struggle between\\nthem, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and\\nhis opponent at the other. In the scufﬂe, your son\\nstruck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then\\nsomething suddenly snapped, and your son, ﬁnding\\nthat he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back,\\nclosed the window, ascended to your room, and had\\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the\\nstruggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when\\nyou appeared upon the scene.”\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names\\nat a moment when he felt that he had deserved your\\nwarmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of\\naffairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the\\nmore chivalrous view, however, and preserved her\\nsecret.”\\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when\\nshe saw the coronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God!\\nwhat a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be\\nallowed to go out for ﬁve minutes! The dear fellow\\nwanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene\\nof the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!”\\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes,\\n“I at once went very carefully round it to observe if\\nthere were any traces in the snow which might help\\nme. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to\\npreserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s\\npath, but found it all trampled down and indistin-\\nguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side\\nof the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked\\nwith a man, whose round impressions on one side\\nshowed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell\\nthat they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe\\nand light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a\\nlittle, and then had gone away. I thought at the time\\nthat this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry\\nshowed it was so. I passed round the garden without\\nseeing anything more than random tracks, which I\\ntook to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the\\nsnow in front of me.\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted\\nman, and a second double line which I saw with de-\\nlight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once\\nconvinced from what you had told me that the latter\\nwas your son. The ﬁrst had walked both ways, but the\\nother had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in\\nplaces over the depression of the boot, it was obvious\\nthat he had passed after the other. I followed them up\\nand found they led to the hall window, where Boots\\nhad worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I\\nwalked to the other end, which was a hundred yards\\nor more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there\\nhad been a struggle, and, ﬁnally, where a few drops of\\nblood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken.\\nBoots had then run down the lane, and another little\\nsmudge of blood showed that it was he who had been\\nhurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end,\\nI found that the pavement had been cleared, so there\\nwas an end to that clue.\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as\\nyou remember, the sill and framework of the hall\\nwindow with my lens, and I could at once see that\\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the out-\\nline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed\\nin coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form\\nan opinion as to what had occurred. A man had\\nwaited outside the window; someone had brought\\n142'),\n",

He had returned with the prize, but had left a\\nfragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was\\nclear. The question now was, who was the man and\\nwho was it brought him the coronet?\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have\\nexcluded the impossible, whatever remains, however\\nimprobable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it\\nwas not you who had brought it down, so there only\\nremained your niece and the maids. But if it were\\nthe maids, why should your son allow himself to be\\naccused in their place? There could be no possible\\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was\\nan excellent explanation why he should retain her\\nsecret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful\\none. When I remembered that you had seen her at\\nthat window, and how she had fainted on seeing the\\ncoronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate?\\nA lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the\\nlove and gratitude which she must feel to you? I\\nknew that you went out little, and that your circle of\\nfriends was a very limited one. But among them was\\nSir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as\\nbeing a man of evil reputation among women. It must\\nhave been he who wore those boots and retained the\\nmissing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had\\ndiscovered him, he might still ﬂatter himself that he\\nwas safe, for the lad could not say a word without\\ncompromising his own family.\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what\\nmeasures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer\\nto Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an acquain-\\ntance with his valet, learned that his master had cut\\nhis head the night before, and, ﬁnally, at the expense\\nof six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of\\nhis cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to\\nStreatham and saw that they exactly ﬁtted the tracks.”\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yester-\\nday evening,” said Mr. Holder.\\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man,\\nso I came home and changed my clothes. It was a\\ndelicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that\\na prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands\\nwere tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At ﬁrst,\\nof course, he denied everything. But when I gave him\\nevery particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster\\nand took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew\\nmy man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head\\nbefore he could strike. Then he became a little more\\nreasonable. I told him that we would give him a price\\nfor the stones he held— £1000 apiece. That brought\\nout the ﬁrst signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why,\\ndash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred\\nfor the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of\\nthe receiver who had them, on promising him that\\nthere would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and\\nafter much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds\\napiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him\\nthat all was right, and eventually got to my bed about\\ntwo o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s\\nwork.”\\n“A day which has saved England from a great\\npublic scandal,” said the banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot\\nﬁnd words to thank you, but you shall not ﬁnd me\\nungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has\\nindeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now\\nI must ﬂy to my dear boy to apologise to him for the\\nwrong which I have done him. As to what you tell\\nme of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even\\nyour skill can inform me where she is now.”\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes,\\n“that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is\\nequally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they\\nwill soon receive a more than sufﬁcient punishment.”\\n143'),\n",

It is pleasant to me to observe, Wat-\\nson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in\\nthese little records of our cases which you have been\\ngood enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occa-\\nsionally to embellish, you have given prominence not\\nso much to the many causes c´el`ebres and sensational\\ntrials in which I have ﬁgured but rather to those inci-\\ndents which may have been trivial in themselves, but\\nwhich have given room for those faculties of deduc-\\ntion and of logical synthesis which I have made my\\nspecial province.”\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold\\nmyself absolved from the charge of sensationalism\\nwhich has been urged against my records.”\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking\\nup a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with\\nit the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to re-\\nplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather\\nthan a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in\\nattempting to put colour and life into each of your\\nstatements instead of conﬁning yourself to the task of\\nplacing upon record that severe reasoning from cause\\nto effect which is really the only notable feature about\\nthe thing.”\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in\\nthe matter,” I remarked with some coldness, for I was\\nrepelled by the egotism which I had more than once\\nobserved to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular\\ncharacter.\\n“No, it is not selﬁshness or conceit,” said he, an-\\nswering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than\\nmy words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is\\nbecause it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond\\nmyself.

But our doubts will very\\nsoon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken,\\nis the person in question.”\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady\\nentered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed,\\nwith a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg,\\nand with the brisk manner of a woman who has had\\nher own way to make in the world.\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,”\\nsaid she, as my companion rose to greet her, “but I\\nhave had a very strange experience, and as I have no\\nparents or relations of any sort from whom I could\\nask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind\\nenough to tell me what I should do.”\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to\\ndo anything that I can to serve you.”\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed\\nby the manner and speech of his new client. He\\nlooked her over in his searching fashion, and then\\ncomposed himself, with his lids drooping and his\\nﬁnger-tips together, to listen to her story.\\n“I have been a governess for ﬁve years,” said she,\\n“in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two\\nmonths ago the colonel received an appointment at\\nHalifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over\\nto America with him, so that I found myself without\\na situation. I advertised, and I answered advertise-\\nments, but without success. At last the little money\\nwhich I had saved began to run short, and I was at\\nmy wit’s end as to what I should do.\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in\\nthe West End called Westaway’s, and there I used to\\ncall about once a week in order to see whether any-\\nthing had turned up which might suit me. Westaway\\nwas the name of the founder of the business, but it is\\nreally managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own lit-\\ntle ofﬁce, and the ladies who are seeking employment\\nwait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by\\none, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether\\nshe has anything which would suit them.\\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into\\nthe little ofﬁce as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper\\nwas not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very\\nsmiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled\\ndown in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her el-\\nbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very\\nearnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he\\ngave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to\\nMiss Stoper.\\n“ ‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for any-\\nthing better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite en-\\nthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most\\ngenial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking\\nman that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\n“ ‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\\n“ ‘Yes, sir.’\\n“ ‘As governess?’\\n“ ‘Yes, sir.’\\n“ ‘And what salary do you ask?’\\n“ ‘I had£4 a month in my last place with Colonel\\nSpence Munro.’\\n“ ‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried,\\nthrowing his fat hands out into the air like a man\\nwho is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer\\nso pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and\\naccomplishments?’\\n“ ‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you\\nimagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, mu-\\nsic, and drawing—’\\n“ ‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the\\nquestion. The point is, have you or have you not the\\nbearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a\\nnutshell. If you have not, you are not ﬁtted for the\\nrearing of a child who may some day play a consider-\\nable part in the history of the country. But if you have\\nwhy, then, how could any gentleman ask you to con-\\ndescend to accept anything under the three ﬁgures?\\nYour salary with me, madam, would commence at\\n£100 a year.’\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, desti-\\ntute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to\\nbe true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the\\nlook of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-\\nbook and took out a note.\\n“ ‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the\\nmost pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two\\nlittle shining slits amid the white creases of his face,\\n‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary be-\\nforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses\\nof their journey and their wardrobe.’\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fasci-\\nnating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already\\nin debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural\\nabout the whole transaction which made me wish to\\nknow a little more before I quite committed myself.\\n“ ‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\n“ ‘Hampshire.

I could not dream of sacriﬁcing it\\nin this offhand fashion.\\n“ ‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said\\nI. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small\\neyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I\\nspoke.\\n“ ‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It\\nis a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you\\nknow, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted.

I cannot tell. Perhaps you\\nhave yourself formed some opinion?”\\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possi-\\nble solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind,\\ngood-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is\\na lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for\\nfear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he\\nhumours her fancies in every way in order to prevent\\nan outbreak?”\\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters\\nstand, it is the most probable one. But in any case\\nit does not seem to be a nice household for a young\\nlady.”\\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good.\\nThat is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give\\nyou £120 a year, when they could have their pick for\\n£40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you\\nwould understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I\\nshould feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at\\nthe back of me.”\\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I\\nassure you that your little problem promises to be the\\nmost interesting which has come my way for some\\nmonths. There is something distinctly novel about\\nsome of the features. If you should ﬁnd yourself in\\ndoubt or in danger—”\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease\\nto be a danger if we could deﬁne it,” said he. “But at\\nany time, day or night, a telegram would bring me\\ndown to your help.”\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair\\nwith the anxiety all swept from her face. “I shall go\\ndown to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I\\nshall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacriﬁce my poor\\nhair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.”\\nWith a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us\\nboth good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, ﬁrm steps\\ndescending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady\\nwho is very well able to take care of herself.”\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely.\\n“I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her\\nbefore many days are past.”\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction\\nwas fulﬁlled. A fortnight went by, during which I\\nfrequently found my thoughts turning in her direc-\\ntion and wondering what strange side-alley of hu-\\nman experience this lonely woman had strayed into.\\nThe unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light\\nduties, all pointed to something abnormal, though\\nwhether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a\\nphilanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my\\npowers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that\\nhe sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted\\nbrows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter\\naway with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.\\n“Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make\\nbricks without clay.” And yet he would always wind\\nup by muttering that no sister of his should ever have\\naccepted such a situation.\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came\\nlate one night just as I was thinking of turning in and\\nHolmes was settling down to one of those all-night\\nchemical researches which he frequently indulged in,\\nwhen I would leave him stooping over a retort and a\\ntest-tube at night and ﬁnd him in the same position\\nwhen I came down to breakfast in the morning.

Holmes had been\\nburied in the morning papers all the way down, but\\nafter we had passed the Hampshire border he threw\\nthem down and began to admire the scenery. It was\\nan ideal spring day, a light blue sky, ﬂecked with little\\nﬂeecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.\\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a\\nman’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the\\nrolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey\\nroofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the\\nlight green of the new foliage.\\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all\\nthe enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker\\nStreet.\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of\\nthe curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must\\nlook at everything with reference to my own special\\nsubject. You look at these scattered houses, and you\\nare impressed by their beauty.

It is\\nmy belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that\\nthe lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present\\na more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling\\nand beautiful countryside.”\\n“You horrify me!”\\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of\\npublic opinion can do in the town what the law cannot\\naccomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream\\nof a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow,\\ndoes not beget sympathy and indignation among the\\nneighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice\\nis ever so close that a word of complaint can set it\\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and\\nthe dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its\\nown ﬁelds, ﬁlled for the most part with poor ignorant\\nfolk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds\\nof hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may\\ngo on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the\\nwiser.

But you shall\\nhave it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr.\\nRucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart\\nto the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large\\nsquare block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained\\nand streaked with damp and bad weather. There are\\ngrounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the\\nfourth a ﬁeld which slopes down to the Southampton\\nhighroad, which curves past about a hundred yards\\nfrom the front door. This ground in front belongs to\\nthe house, but the woods all round are part of Lord\\nSoutherton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches\\nimmediately in front of the hall door has given its\\nname to the place.\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was\\nas amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that\\nevening to his wife and the child. There was no truth,\\nMr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to\\nbe probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Ru-\\ncastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced\\nwoman, much younger than her husband, not more\\nthan thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less\\nthan forty-ﬁve. From their conversation I have gath-\\nered that they have been married about seven years,\\nthat he was a widower, and that his only child by the\\nﬁrst wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadel-\\nphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason\\nwhy she had left them was that she had an unreason-\\ning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could\\nnot have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine\\nthat her position must have been uncomfortable with\\nher father’s young wife.\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in\\nmind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither\\nfavourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It\\nwas easy to see that she was passionately devoted\\nboth to her husband and to her little son. Her light\\ngrey eyes wandered continually from one to the other,\\nnoting every little want and forestalling it if possible.\\nHe was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion,\\nand on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She\\nwould often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest\\nlook upon her face. More than once I have surprised\\nher in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was\\nthe disposition of her child which weighed upon her\\nmind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so\\nill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age,\\nwith a head which is quite disproportionately large.\\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation\\nbetween savage ﬁts of passion and gloomy intervals\\nof sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than\\nhimself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\\nhe shows quite remarkable talent in planning the cap-\\nture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would\\nrather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and,\\nindeed, he has little to do with my story.”\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend,\\n“whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance.\\nThe one unpleasant thing about the house, which\\nstruck me at once, was the appearance and conduct\\nof the servants. There are only two, a man and his\\nwife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth\\nman, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual\\nsmell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he\\nhas been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\\ntake no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong\\nwoman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle\\nand much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant\\ncouple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in\\nthe nursery and my own room, which are next to each\\nother in one corner of the building.\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper\\nBeeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs.\\nRucastle came down just after breakfast and whis-\\npered something to her husband.\\n“ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very\\nmuch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with\\nour whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you\\nthat it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\\nappearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue\\ndress will become you. You will ﬁnd it laid out upon\\nthe bed in your room, and if you would be so good\\nas to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a\\npeculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a\\nsort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having\\nbeen worn before. It could not have been a better\\nﬁt if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs.\\nRucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which\\nseemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They\\nwere waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a\\nvery large room, stretching along the entire front of\\nthe house, with three long windows reaching down to\\nthe ﬂoor.

You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I\\nlaughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, how-\\never, who has evidently no sense of humour, never\\nso much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap,\\nand a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour\\nor so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was\\ntime to commence the duties of the day, and that I\\nmight change my dress and go to little Edward in the\\nnursery.\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone\\nthrough under exactly similar circumstances. Again\\nI changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and\\nagain I laughed very heartily at the funny stories\\nof which my employer had an immense r ´epertoire,\\nand which he told inimitably. Then he handed me\\na yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon\\nthe page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read\\nfor about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a\\nchapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sen-\\ntence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious\\nI became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary\\nperformance could possibly be. They were always\\nvery careful, I observed, to turn my face away from\\nthe window, so that I became consumed with the de-\\nsire to see what was going on behind my back. At\\nﬁrst it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a\\nmeans. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy\\nthought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\\nglass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in\\nthe midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up\\nto my eyes, and was able with a little management\\nto see all that there was behind me. I confess that I\\nwas disappointed. There was nothing. At least that\\nwas my ﬁrst impression. At the second glance, how-\\never, I perceived that there was a man standing in the\\nSouthampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey\\nsuit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The\\nroad is an important highway, and there are usually\\npeople there. This man, however, was leaning against\\nthe railings which bordered our ﬁeld and was looking\\nearnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced\\nat Mrs. Rucastle to ﬁnd her eyes ﬁxed upon me with\\na most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am\\nconvinced that she had divined that I had a mirror\\nin my hand and had seen what was behind me. She\\nrose at once.\\n“ ‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow\\nupon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\\n“ ‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\n“ ‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\\n“ ‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn\\nround and motion to him to go away.’\\n“ ‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\\n“ ‘No, no, we should have him loitering here al-\\nways. Kindly turn round and wave him away like\\nthat.’\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs.\\nRucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago,\\nand from that time I have not sat again in the window,\\nnor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in\\nthe road.”\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative\\npromises to be a most interesting one.”\\n“You will ﬁnd it rather disconnected, I fear, and\\nthere may prove to be little relation between the dif-\\nferent incidents of which I speak. On the very ﬁrst\\nday that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle\\ntook me to a small outhouse which stands near the\\nkitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp\\nrattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal\\nmoving about.\\n“ ‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a\\nslit between two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glow-\\ning eyes, and of a vague ﬁgure huddled up in the\\ndarkness.\\n“ ‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laugh-\\ning at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo,\\nmy mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my\\ngroom, is the only man who can do anything with\\nhim. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,\\nso that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets\\nhim loose every night, and God help the trespasser\\nwhom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake\\ndon’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the\\nthreshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is\\nworth.’\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later\\nI happened to look out of my bedroom window about\\ntwo o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moon-\\nlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was stand-\\ning, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when\\nI was aware that something was moving under the\\nshadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as\\nlarge as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black\\nmuzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly\\nacross the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon\\nthe other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to\\n153'),\n",

I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London,\\nand I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my\\ntrunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began\\nto amuse myself by examining the furniture of my\\nroom and by rearranging my own little things. There\\nwas an old chest of drawers in the room, the two\\nupper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I\\nhad ﬁlled the ﬁrst two with my linen, and as I had\\nstill much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at\\nnot having the use of the third drawer. It struck me\\nthat it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,\\nso I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.\\nThe very ﬁrst key ﬁtted to perfection, and I drew the\\ndrawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am\\nsure that you would never guess what it was. It was\\nmy coil of hair.\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same\\npeculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the\\nimpossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.\\nHow could my hair have been locked in the drawer?\\nWith trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out\\nthe contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\\nI laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that\\nthey were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puz-\\nzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what\\nit meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,\\nand I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I\\nfelt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\\ndrawer which they had locked.\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have re-\\nmarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good\\nplan of the whole house in my head. There was one\\nwing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at\\nall. A door which faced that which led into the quar-\\nters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\\ninvariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended\\nthe stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this\\ndoor, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face\\nwhich made him a very different person to the round,\\njovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks\\nwere red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\\nthe veins stood out at his temples with passion. He\\nlocked the door and hurried past me without a word\\nor a look.\\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out\\nfor a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled\\nround to the side from which I could see the windows\\nof this part of the house. There were four of them\\nin a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the\\nfourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all de-\\nserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them\\noccasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\\nmerry and jovial as ever.\\n“ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I\\npassed you without a word, my dear young lady. I\\nwas preoccupied with business matters.’\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the\\nway,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare\\nrooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’\\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a\\nlittle startled at my remark.\\n“ ‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I\\nhave made my dark room up there. But, dear me!\\nwhat an observant young lady we have come upon.\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever\\nbelieved it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was\\nno jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion\\nthere and annoyance, but no jest.\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I under-\\nstood that there was something about that suite of\\nrooms which I was not to know, I was all on ﬁre to go\\nover them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have\\nmy share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a\\nfeeling that some good might come from my pene-\\ntrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct;\\nperhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that\\nfeeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly\\non the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden\\ndoor.\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I\\nmay tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller\\nand his wife ﬁnd something to do in these deserted\\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black\\nlinen bag with him through the door. Recently he has\\nbeen drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was\\nvery drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the\\nkey in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had\\nleft it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down-\\nstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an\\nadmirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the\\nlock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpa-\\npered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle\\nat the farther end. Round this corner were three doors\\nin a line, the ﬁrst and third of which were open. They\\neach led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless,\\nwith two windows in the one and one in the other, so\\nthick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly\\nthrough them. The centre door was closed, and across\\nthe outside of it had been fastened one of the broad\\nbars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring\\n154'),\n",

This barricaded door corresponded clearly\\nwith the shuttered window outside, and yet I could\\nsee by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was\\nnot in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which\\nlet in light from above. As I stood in the passage\\ngazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret\\nit might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps\\nwithin the room and saw a shadow pass backward\\nand forward against the little slit of dim light which\\nshone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning\\nterror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My\\noverstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned\\nand ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were\\nbehind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed\\ndown the passage, through the door, and straight into\\nthe arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n“ ‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought\\nthat it must be when I saw the door open.’\\n“ ‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\\n“ ‘My dear young lady! my dear young\\nlady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing\\nhis manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my\\ndear young lady?’\\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He\\noverdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\\n“ ‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’\\nI answered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim\\nlight that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it\\nis so dreadfully still in there!’\\n“ ‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\n“ ‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\n“ ‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\\n“ ‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\n“ ‘It is to keep people out who have no business\\nthere. Do you see?’ He was still smiling in the most\\namiable manner.\\n“ ‘I am sure if I had known—’\\n“ ‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put\\nyour foot over that threshold again’—here in an in-\\nstant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he\\nglared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll\\nthrow you to the mastiff.’\\n“I was so terriﬁed that I do not know what I did.\\nI suppose that I must have rushed past him into my\\nroom. I remember nothing until I found myself lying\\non my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without\\nsome advice. I was frightened of the house, of the\\nman, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child.\\nThey were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have\\nﬂed from the house, but my curiosity was almost as\\nstrong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I\\nwould send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak,\\nwent down to the ofﬁce, which is about half a mile\\nfrom the house, and then returned, feeling very much\\neasier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I ap-\\nproached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I\\nremembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state\\nof insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was\\nthe only one in the household who had any inﬂuence\\nwith the savage creature, or who would venture to set\\nhim free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the\\nnight in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had\\nno difﬁculty in getting leave to come into Winchester\\nthis morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and\\nwill be away all the evening, so that I must look after\\nthe child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr.\\nHolmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell\\nme what it all means, and, above all, what I should\\ndo.”\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this ex-\\ntraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up\\nand down the room, his hands in his pockets, and\\nan expression of the most profound gravity upon his\\nface.\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she\\ncould do nothing with him.”\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this\\nmatter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter.\\nDo you think that you could perform one more feat?\\nI should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\\nexceptional woman.”\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven\\no’clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone\\nby that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable.\\nThere only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the\\nalarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some\\nerrand, and then turn the key upon her, you would\\nfacilitate matters immensely.”\\n“I will do it.”\\n155'),\n",

We shall then look thoroughly into\\nthe affair. Of course there is only one feasible expla-\\nnation. You have been brought there to personate\\nsomeone, and the real person is imprisoned in this\\nchamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner\\nis, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Al-\\nice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\\nhave gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless,\\nas resembling her in height, ﬁgure, and the colour\\nof your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in\\nsome illness through which she has passed, and so, of\\ncourse, yours had to be sacriﬁced also. By a curious\\nchance you came upon her tresses. The man in the\\nroad was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly\\nher ﬁanc ´e—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress\\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your\\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from\\nyour gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy,\\nand that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring\\nto communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The\\nmost serious point in the case is the disposition of the\\nchild.”\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejacu-\\nlated.\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are con-\\ntinually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child\\nby the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the\\nconverse is equally valid. I have frequently gained\\nmy ﬁrst real insight into the character of parents by\\nstudying their children. This child’s disposition is ab-\\nnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether\\nhe derives this from his smiling father, as I should\\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor\\ngirl who is in their power.”\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried\\nour client. “A thousand things come back to me\\nwhich make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let\\nus lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\ncreature.”\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with\\na very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven\\no’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will\\nnot be long before we solve the mystery.”\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven\\nwhen we reached the Copper Beeches, having put\\nup our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of\\ntrees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished\\nmetal in the light of the setting sun, were sufﬁcient\\nto mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been\\nstanding smiling on the door-step.\\n“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere\\ndownstairs. “That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,” said\\nshe. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.\\nHere are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\nRucastle’s.”\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with\\nenthusiasm. “Now lead the way, and we shall soon\\nsee the end of this black business.”\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, fol-\\nlowed on down a passage, and found ourselves in\\nfront of the barricade which Miss Hunter had de-\\nscribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the trans-\\nverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock,\\nbut without success. No sound came from within,\\nand at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think,\\nMiss Hunter, that we had better go in without you.\\nNow, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall\\nsee whether we cannot make our way in.”\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once be-\\nfore our united strength. Together we rushed into the\\nroom. It was empty. There was no furniture save a\\nlittle pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen.\\nThe skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes;\\n“this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions\\nand has carried his victim off.”\\n“But how?”\\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how\\nhe managed it.” He swung himself up onto the roof.\\n“Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a long light\\nladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the lad-\\nder was not there when the Rucastles went away.”\\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he\\nis a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very\\nmuch surprised if this were he whose step I hear now\\nupon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as\\nwell for you to have your pistol ready.”\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before\\na man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat\\nand burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss\\nHunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the\\nsight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward\\nand confronted him.\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at\\nthe open skylight.\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you\\nthieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I?\\n156'),\n",

We had hardly\\nreached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound,\\nand then a scream of agony, with a horrible worry-\\ning sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An\\nelderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came\\nstaggering out at a side door.\\n“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the\\ndog. It’s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or\\nit’ll be too late!”\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle\\nof the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There\\nwas the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried\\nin Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed\\nupon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out,\\nand it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting\\nin the great creases of his neck. With much labour\\nwe separated them and carried him, living but hor-\\nribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon\\nthe drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the\\nsobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what\\nI could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled\\nround him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt\\nwoman entered the room.\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came\\nback before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity\\nyou didn’t let me know what you were planning, for\\nI would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is\\nclear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter\\nthan anyone else.”\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what\\nI know.”\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there\\nare several points on which I must confess that I am\\nstill in the dark.”\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and\\nI’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out\\nfrom the cellar. If there’s police-court business over\\nthis, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood\\nyour friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t,\\nfrom the time that her father married again. She\\nwas slighted like and had no say in anything, but it\\nnever really became bad for her until after she met\\nMr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could\\nlearn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but\\nshe was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never\\nsaid a word about them but just left everything in\\nMr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her;\\nbut when there was a chance of a husband coming\\nforward, who would ask for all that the law would\\ngive him, then her father thought it time to put a stop\\non it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether\\nshe married or not, he could use her money. When\\nshe wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she\\ngot brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door.\\nThen she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and\\nwith her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make\\nno change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\\ntrue as man could be.”\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have\\nbeen good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly\\nclear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr.\\nRucastle then, I presume, took to this system of im-\\nprisonment?”\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in\\norder to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr.\\nFowler.”\\n“That was it, sir.”\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a\\ngood seaman should be, blockaded the house, and\\nhaving met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your\\ninterests were the same as his.”\\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed\\ngentleman,” said Mrs. Toller serenely.\\n“And in this way he managed that your good\\nman should have no want of drink, and that a ladder\\nshould be ready at the moment when your master\\nhad gone out.”\\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,”\\nsaid Holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up every-\\nthing which puzzled us. And here comes the country\\nsurgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that\\nwe had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,\\nas it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a\\nquestionable one.”\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister\\nhouse with the copper beeches in front of the door.
